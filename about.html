    Hi, I'm Kaylee. Welcome to my site.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I am a third year undergraduate student, studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology 
    (IIT) in Chicago, IL. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I have always had an affinity for STEM; I grew up fiddling with puzzles and solving any equation I could get my hands on. 
    Now, I explore the union of math and CS: algorithms and proofs, programming and logic, the concrete and the abstract.
  </p>
  <p>
    I plan on graduating with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics and a Master's in Computer Science. 
    I am currently doing research in statistics with
    <a href="https://sites.google.com/iit.edu/lulukang/" target="_blank">
    Professor Lulu Kang</a>.
    At IIT, I am the co-treasurer for Women in STEM, TA for the math department, and student council member for the College of Computing.
