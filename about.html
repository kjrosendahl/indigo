    Hi, I'm Kaylee, also known as kjrosendahl (in one cadence). Welcome to my site. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I'm a fourth year, studying for an MS in Computer Science and BS in Applied Mathematics at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) 
    in Chicago, IL. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This started as a small, independent passion project. My advisor recommended I make a website to showcase my skills and work. I doubled down and 
    studied HTML and CSS, clicked through tutorials on Github pages, and stayed up all night perfecting on-hover shadow boxes. 
  </p>

  <p>
    I think he meant something like a Google site. However, as I've remarked to a friend, "people are only as ambitious as is expected of them."
    I don't intend on merely fulfilling expectations. 
  </p>

  <p>
    So, I've been growing this site, line by line. I hope to keep learning more about front-end development, and implementing new features 
    in a way that truly reflects my interests, personality, and style. After all, a resume can only do so much. 
  </p>

  <p>Any questions? Reach out; I'd love to get to know you!</p>
