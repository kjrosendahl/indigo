    I graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) in Chicago, IL, in May 2024. 
    I recieved my Master's in Computer Science and my Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics. 
  </p>

  <p>
    This started as a minor project; my advisor recommended I make a website to showcase my skills and work. I doubled down and began studying HTML, 
    clicked through tutorials on Github pages, and stayed up all night tinkering with on-hover shadow boxes.

    He definitely meant something like a Google site. However, as I've remarked to a friend, "people are only as ambitious as is expected of them."
    I don't intend on merely fulfilling expectations. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Having left a life of academia, I hope to get back into writing and designing, reflecting my interests, personality, and personal flair. 
    After all, a resume can only do so much.

    Aside from professional endeavors, I live for reading, writing, traveling, cooking, collecting art, 
    creating playlists, watching and rating movies, eating A LOT of food, and making wicked birthday cards.
