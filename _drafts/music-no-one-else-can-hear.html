desription: "My relationship with music as an afterthought"
--- 

<p>
    My relationship with music is complicated. The music seems to control me, rather than the other way around. 
</p>

<p>
    It wasn't always that way. Growing up, it was more detached. I certainly listened to songs: from my dad's record player, on
    the radio, watching music videos on YouTube. I made my first playlist in high school. It had no theme or meaning, as many 
    tend to have. Instead, I just added songs I liked more than others, and would consistently <i>only</i> listen to that playlist. 
    Throughout three years, I racked up 12 hours - ranging from Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco to Maroon 5 
    and One Direction. 
</p>

<p>
    Around that time, I became enamored with the lyrics. I would write lines on my arms in ink every day, and 
    keep a list of which stanzas were my favorite. The criteria? How the words felt on my tongue. 
</p>

<p>
    There were words that tasted sweet: swirling melodically, maybe a little heartbroken; words with a strong cadence: transitioning from 
    slick to biting so fast, it left you breathless; words that echoed in your head: haunting and melancholic, crooning for a life 
    you couldn't remember; words that danced in your mouth: popping and fizzing, like fireworks; words saturated with color, 
    or <!--figure out how to end??-->
</p>

<p>
    That interest - or maybe obsession - remains today, only with a different set of songs. 
</p>

<p>
    I branched out more once I reached my sophomore year of college. I let Spotify choose what I listened to, looping 
    my "recommended" feed in the background while I worked on homework. When I started recognizing songs, and didn't hate them 
    entirely, I'd add them to a new playlist. Many of them were indie, with little-known artists. 
    They became familiar, much like my high school tracks. 
</p>

<p>
    Eventually, I started breaking ground in my Spotify library. I meticulously organized playlists into cascading folders 
    and sub-lists, found the perfect names and captions, re-discovered old music, and stumbled upon new songs by chance. 
    But, that's when I realized: music had started to interweave into periods of my life. <!--grammar?-->
</p>

<p>
    There's an old scene from <i>Mad Men</i>, where 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus" target="_blank">Don Draper pitches Kodak's slide projector</a> 
    as part of an ad campaign. He flips through personal photos in the dim, smoky meeting room:

    <blockquote cite="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus">
        <p>
            "Teddy told me that in Greek, nostalgia literally means 'the pain from an old wound.' 
            It's a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a space ship. 
            It's a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. Takes us to a place where we ache to go again."
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    Likewise, when I listen to music, I'm swept backwards and forwards in time. It's more than a simple 
    memory. All my senses are flooded: the same scents, images, emotions. 
</p>

<p>
    Sometimes, this is welcoming. Hearing 
    "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5Z3GHaZ6ec9bsiI5BenrbY?si=d41a3fcfbb984f9a" target="_blank">Young, Dumb, and Broke</a>" 
    takes me back to being buried in sand, half-asleep, feeling the sun's warmth, the taste of strawberries lingering in my mouth. 
    "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/58iCq0hR2Emv6DZNxj7mGa?si=8a48721d75134afc" target="_blank">June</a>" 
    leaves me flushing, smelling the autumn breeze, adrenaline pumping.  
    One of my favorite songs, 
    "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7sljA9XJXVCbbXLK5XpDtu?si=fda97279158c424c" target="_blank">Maybe</a>", 
    slows down my heartrate, reminded of the way rain splatters across the windows of my campus center. 
</p>

<p>
    Other times, it renders me unable to listen to songs I once loved. 
    "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0GO8y8jQk1PkHzS31d699N?si=57de2e8c82814216" target="_blank">Tongue Tied</a>" 
    and "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/63OB8oKmBUUYiRtrRtFCvX?si=4d23e37362874189" target="_blank">Girl</a>" 
    make me nauseous, while 
    "<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7dKdQiS6jWWCg5bOj7Ag8y?si=438d61ab7444409b" target="_blank">Fall Together</a>" 
    hollows me out. 
</p>

<p>
    Selecting a certain playlist sets me back to the time I first made it. Some are inextricably tied to cities I've 
    visited, or even to entire semesters. Music has become the fastest way to escape reality. 
    A few times, I've created playlists right before traveling, with the hopes of binding the memories.
    It never worked. It felt inorganic, no matter how hard I tried. 
</p>

<p>
    So, where does that leave me? 
</p>

<p>
    When I feel lonely, I play Taylor Swift's <i>Lover</i>: it kept me company in San Fransisco. 
    When I need motivation, I play Melanie Martinez's <i>K-12</i>: it's reminiscent of my runs along Lake Michigan. 
    And when I ache to be somewhere else, or with someone else? 
</p>

<p>
    There's a song, waiting to be heard. 
</p>

<!--Something about: joy in creating names and captions, careful organization, realizing how they started representing points 
in my life, and how inorganically creating playlists never go well-->
