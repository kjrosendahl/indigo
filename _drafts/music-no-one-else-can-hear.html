desription: "My relationship with music as an afterthought"
--- 

<p>
    My relationship with music is complicated. The music seems to control me, rather than the other way around. 
</p>

<p>
    It wasn't always that way. Growing up, it was more detached. I certainly listened to songs: from my dad's record player, to 
    the radio, to music videos on YouTube. I made my first playlist in high school. It had no theme or meaning, as many 
    tend to have. Instead, I just added songs I liked more than others, and would consistently <i>only</i> listen to that playlist. 
    Throughout three years, I racked up 12 hours - ranging from Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco to Maroon 5 
    and Taylor Swift.

    Around that time, I became enamored with the lyrics. I would write lines on my arms in ink every day, and 
    keep a list of which stanzas were my favorite. The criteria? How the words felt on my tongue. 
    
    Words that tasted sweet: looping melodically, maybe a little heartbroken; words with a strong cadence: transitioning from 
    slick to biting so fast, it leaves you breathless; words that echo in your head: haunting and melancholic, crooning for a life 
    you can't remember; words that dance in your mouth: popping and fizzing, like fireworks; words that are saturated with color,
    or feel playful, or have deeper meanings, or say everything you can't bring yourself to say. 
</p>

<p>
    That interest - or maybe obsession - remains today, only with a new set of songs. 
</p>

<p>
    My music taste finally started branching out when I reached my sophomore year of college. Turns out, there's only so many 
    times you can listen to the same songs over and over again.
