desription: "My relationship with music as an afterthought"
--- 

<p>
    My relationship with music is complicated. The music seems to control me, rather than the other way around. 
</p>

<p>
    It wasn't always that way. Growing up, it was more detached. I certainly listened to songs: from my dad's record player, to 
    the radio, to music videos on YouTube. I made my first playlist in high school on Spotify. It had no theme or meaning, as many 
    tend to have. Instead, I just added songs I liked more than others, and would consistently <i>only</i> listen to that playlist. 
    Throughout four years, I managed to rack up 12 hours - ranging from Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco to Maroon 5 
    and Taylor Swift.

    Around that time, I became enamored with the lyrics. I would write lines on my arms in ink every day, and 
    keep a list of which stanzas were my favorite. The criteria? How the words felt on my tongue. I liked the ones that tasted sweet - 
    looping and flowing, and maybe a little heartbroken. Or, those that had a strong cadence - transitioning from slick to biting so 
    fast, it left you breathless.
