desription: "My relationship with music as an afterthought"
--- 

<p>
    My relationship with music is complicated. The music seems to control me, rather than the other way around. 
</p>

<p>
    It wasn't always that way. Growing up, it was more detached. I certainly listened to songs: from my dad's record player, on
    the radio, watching music videos on YouTube. I made my first playlist in high school. It had no theme or meaning, as many 
    tend to have. Instead, I just added songs I liked more than others, and would consistently <i>only</i> listen to that playlist. 
    Throughout three years, I racked up 12 hours - ranging from Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco to Maroon 5 
    and Taylor Swift. 
</p>

<p>
    Around that time, I became enamored with the lyrics. I would write lines on my arms in ink every day, and 
    keep a list of which stanzas were my favorite. The criteria? How the words felt on my tongue. 
    
    There were words that tasted sweet: swirling melodically, maybe a little heartbroken; words with a strong cadence: transitioning from 
    slick to biting so fast, it left you breathless; words that echoed in your head: haunting and melancholic, crooning for a life 
    you couldn't remember; words that danced in your mouth: popping and fizzing, like fireworks; words saturated with color, 
    or <!--figure out how to end??-->
</p>

<p>
    That interest - or maybe obsession - remains today, only with a different set of songs. 
</p>

<p>
    I branched out more once I reached my sophomore year of college. I let Spotify choose what I listened to, looping 
    my "recommended" feed in the background while I worked on homework. When I started recognizing songs, and didn't hate them 
    entirely, I'd add them to a new playlist. Many of them were indie, with little-known artists. 
    They became familiar, much like my high school tracks. 
</p>

<p>
    Eventually, I started breaking ground in my Spotify library. I meticulously organized playlists into cascading folders 
    and sub-lists, found the perfect names and captions, re-discovered old music, and stumbled upon new songs by chance. 
    But, as I kept making playlists, I realized the they started entwining themselves into periods of my life.

    There's an old scene from <i>Mad Men</i>, where 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suRDUFpsHus" target="_blank">Don Draper pitches Kodak's slide projector</a> 
    as part of an ad campaign. He flips through personal photos in the dim, smoky meeting room, 
    showing his wedding day, his kids, his summer days:

            "Teddy told me that in Greek, nostalgia literally means 'the pain from an old wound.' 
            It's a twinge in your heart, far more powerful than memory alone. This device isn't a space ship. 
            It's a time machine. It goes backwards, forwards. Takes us to a place where we ache to go again."

in my life, and how inorganically creating playlists never go well-->
