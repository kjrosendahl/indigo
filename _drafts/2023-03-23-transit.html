description: "My personal ranking of major city public transit lines"
--- 

<p>
    Let me tell you about the first time I tried taking the CTA.
</p>

<p>
    Imagine me: bright eyed, fresh out of high school, looking to start a new life in Chicago. I had always dreamed of living somewhere big; 
    growing up in the middle of nowhere will do that to you. The thrill of independence kept me alert, excited. 
</p>

<p>
    Upon recieving my Ventra card, I meticulously planned my first trip: hop the Green line at IIT, ride two stops down to Roosevelt, walk half a mile to Target, 
    and don't get attacked on the way there. I paced back and forth under the elevated tracks, heart pounding, head roaring with the echoes of the train rushing past me. 
</p>

<p>
    When I finally gathered the courage to scan my pass, I was denied. I tried to load fares at an extraordinary loud 
    CTA machine, which also didn't work. Embarassed, I slunk back to my dorm, convinced I had done something wrong. 
</p>

<p>
    Turns out, you have to activate your card by phone. It's not like there's instructions on the back, or anything. 
</p>

<p>
    Since then, I've visited many different cities. Many transit systems nowadays encourage buying passes on your phone, but I 
    much prefer collecting the physical cards. There's something uniquely exhilarating about recieving that card: in your hand, you 
    have the opportunity to go anywhere. Catch the T, ride the subway, chase after an SF trolley: it's a new adventure. 
    Whenever I travel somewhere new, I fall in love with that independence, over and over again. 
    <!-- And I still fall in love with that independence - it's like I belong there. Or that I'm capable of something, so different than normal life.  -->
</p>

<p>
    As of 3/23/23, I've collected seven cards: Chicago, Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Boston, and Washington, DC.
    Since I am clearly an expert on all things public transit, I've decided to rank each of their systems by the following: 
</p>

<p>
    <b>Ease of Access</b> (2)
    <ul>
        <li>How easy is it to find their stations?</li>
        <li>Is navigation difficult?</li>
        <li>Are their elevators ever working?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Speed and Consistency</b> (3)
    <ul>
        <li>Is taking the transit any faster than walking?</li>
        <li>Do the trains/buses ever ghost passengers?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>User Experience (UX)</b> (3)
    <ul>
        <li>How are the views?</li>
        <li>Are you comfortable, or always on the edge because of the K9s swarming the car?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Aesthetic</b> (1)
    <ul>
        <li>How cool is the design of the stations?</li>
        <li>Will taking a picture be Instagram-able?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    <b>Card</b> (1)
    <ul>
        <li>Is the transit card neat?</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    Each category will be rated out of 10. The final scoring is achieved by multiplying each category score by its corresponding weight (as described above), 
    then summed up. The maximum rating a city can achieve is 10/10. In mathematical notation:

    Let's get started!

<h3>1. Chicago</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <figure>
        <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/transit-ranking/chi-map.jpg" alt="map of Chicago train lines by color" style="max-width: 65%;">
        <figcaption>The CTA train lines, or the L</figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>
<p>
    Chicago boasts about its unique "L" trains, short for "elevated." Rather than running underground, most
    tracks lie overhead. It's second nature to go silent once a train passes above you, then continue your conversation afterwards. 
    In total, there are eight lines, all of which converge in a "loop" shape in downtown Chi (thus, the inspiration behind the area's nickname: The Loop). 
</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/transit-ranking/mtcc.jpg" alt="IIT McCormick Tribune Campus Center in the fall">
</div>

<p>
    Fun fact: IIT has its own stop off the Green line, entitled "35th-Bronzeville-IIT."
    The track runs above our campus center, which was built second. 
    To dampen the sound, the architect built a large metal structure enclosing the line, which makes for a very cool tunnel.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Ease of Access
    </b>
    <br>
    For the most part, follow the tracks: since they're above ground, you'll find a stop eventually. 
    Unfortunately, there's always two sets of stairs, only one of which you're allowed to go <i>up</i>. Additionally, 
    very rarely will you see escalators at a station, let alone working escalators - I'm convinced the elevators are a thing of fantasy. 
    Score: 4/10.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Speed and Consistency
    </b>
    <br>
    Boasting a top speed of 55mph, train rides aren't nearly as bad. I can head to the Loop within 30 minutes by bus, or 
    15 minutes by train. On the other hand, consistency is hard to come by. Buses are quite unreliable, often 
    passing by the stop or not showing up. 
    There's been a handful of times when a line is out of service, so passengers must exit the train and take a shuttle bus 
    to the next few stops, easily adding 25 minutes to your commute. Chicago, do better. 
    Score: 3/10.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        UX
    </b>
    <br>
    I will say, taking the train is unpleasant if you're on half the lines (typically those that run through the South Side). 
    The Red line is notorious for being unsafe, especially at night, 
    so I avoid it as much as I can.  
    On the busiest days, you have to push your way in, or wait for the next train. 
    The floors are usually pretty dirty, and salty in the winter. I won't comment on the smell.
    A huge pitfall of elevated tracks? Having to wait outside in winter months. There might be one or two heated areas, but 
    they don't always work. 
    The only reason this category gains any points: the views. It's beautiful, once you enter downtown. Passing between skyscrapers, 
    looking over the Chicago river, gorgeous graffiti murals stretching 20 stories tall: there's nothing quite like it. 
    Score: 3/10.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Aesthetic
    </b>
    <br>
    Most of the time, it's not very pretty. The support beams are rusted, and the stations themselves aren't too inspiring. 
    Nothing really to comment on. 
    Score: 4/10.

    I have a special student pass with my picture on it, so not ideal. However, regular Ventra cards have a beautiful gradient of blue triangles, 
    which is pleasing. 
    Score: 7/10.

    Calculated score: <b>3.7/10</b>.

<h3>2. Toronto</h3>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>
    Although Toronto uses a combination of buses, subway cars, and streetcars, the most common transit service in the downtown area 
    are the streetcars! 
</p>

<p>
    Having recently watched Turning Red, I was delighted to step out of the wintery snow and onto the bright red bus. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Ease of Access
    </b>
    <br>
    Like I said, most take the streetcars. I suppose there's nothing too difficult about finding a bus stop, even in the cold winter. 
    For its rail-lines, each station is fairly easy to spot, with escalators and wide turnstiles. Not bad! 
    Score: 6/10. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Speed and Consistency
    </b>
    <br>
    Sometimes when I travel, I'm stuck between waiting for a late bus, or booking it down the streets (to the amusement of native city-goers). 
    However, I think every train or bus came on time, and with a smoothness I did not expect (coming from janky CTA trains that throw you left and right). 
    Unfortunately, I don't carry a speedometer, but I think the speed was satsifactory. 
    Score: 7/10.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        UX
    </b>
    <br>
    Upon hopping aboard our first streetcar, my friend and I giggled at the quirkiness of the bus, with its ecletic placement of seats and 
    vastness. Likewise, on the train, we were in awe of the open space, nearly two or three times as wide as a standard CTA car. 
    Both types of transit rides were smooth and scarily calm and quiet. Maybe Torontonians are built different. 
    Score: 8/10. 
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Aesthetic 
    </b>
    <br>
    I can't quite remember exactly what the stations looked like, besides residing underground. I think I was too excited by the prospect of 
    taking a train that didn't set you on edge. Let's give it a solid: 
    Score: 6/10. 
</p>

<h3>3. Los Angeles</h3>

<div class="text-center">

</div>

<p>
    My <a href="{% link _posts/blog/2022-12-29-adventures-in-LA.html %}">first experience with LA transit</a> involved taking an LAX shuttle to 
    catch a garishly-orange bus to UCLA. My second one, a Saturday trip to "downtown" LA, took nearly two hours, to my horror. 
</p>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/transit-ranking/la-bus.jpg" alt="orange LA bus" style="max-width:75%">
</div>

<p>
    Somehow, the journey was shorter using buses rather than trains. 
    Still, those trips rquired at least one transfer, so much that I opted to split an Uber on several occassions. 
    I now realize LA isn't exactly commuter-friendly, so if you 
    don't like me bashing SoCal transit, I'd recommend skipping ahead to San Francisco.
