<p>
    Let me tell you about the first time I tried taking the CTA.
</p>

<p>
    Imagine me: bright eyed, fresh out of high school, looking to start a new life in Chicago. I had always dreamed of living somewhere big; 
    growing up in the middle of nowhere will do that to you. The thrill of independence kept me alert, excited. 
</p>

<p>
    Upon recieving my Ventra card, I meticulously planned my first trip: hop the green line at IIT, ride two stops down to Roosevelt, walk half a mile to Target, 
    and don't get attacked on the way there. I paced back and forth under the elevated tracks, heart pounding, head roaring with the echoes of the train rushing past me. 
</p>

<p>
    When I finally gathered the courage to scan my pass, I was denied. I tried to load fares onto the card, which also didn't work. 
    Embarassed, I slinked back to my dorm, convinced I had done something wrong. 
</p>

<p>
    Turns out, you have to activate your card by phone. It's not like there's instructions on the back, or anything. 
</p>

<p>
    Since then, I've had the opportunity to travel many different cities. Many transit systems nowadays encourage buying passes on your phone, but I 
    much prefer collecting the physical cards. There's something uniquely exhilarating about recieving that card: in your hand, you 
    have the opportunity to go anywhere. Catch the T, ride the subway, chase after an SF trolley: it's a new adventure. 
    And I still fall in love with that independence - it's like I belong there. Or that I'm capable of something, so different than normal life. 
</p>

<p>
    As of 3/23/23, I've collected seven cards: Chicago, Toronto, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York City, Boston, and Washington, DC.
    Since I am clearly an expert on all things public transit, I've decided to rank each of their systems by the following: 
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ease of Access: how easy is it to find their stations? Is navigation difficult? Are their elevators ever working? (2)</li>
        <li>Speed and Consistency: is taking the transit any faster than walking? And do the trains/buses ever ghost passengers? (3)</li>
        <li>User Experience (UX): </li>
        <li>Aesthetic: how cool is the design of the stations? Will taking a picture be Instagram-able? (1)</li>
        <li>Card: how much does adding this card to my collection increase its value? (1)</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    Each category will be rated out of 10. The final scoring is achieved by multiplying each category score by its corresponding weight (as described above), 
    then summed up. The maximum rating a city can achieve is 10/10. In mathematical notation:
