<p class="text-center"> 
    Spring break brought me four days of experiencing DC, enthralled by cherry blossom themes and all kinds of art. 
    I spent most of my time bouncing around museums, catching fun restaurants, and gazing at gorgeous painted ceilings. 
    Feel free to live vicariously through these photos, bursting with color and light.
