<!-- Sherlock, bojack horseman, demon slayer, madmen, kakegurui, fleabag, you -->

<p>
    Rounding out the entertainment trifecta: my favorite TV shows. I've rewatched these multiple times, often 
    late at night, freshly showered and curled up in bed. Shall we begin? 
</p>

<h3>1. Sherlock (2010-2017)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/sherlock-wedding.jpg" alt="sherlock and moriarty drinking tea" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>mystery, crime, drama</i></p>
</div>

        </p>

<p>
    Not to be a 2014 Tumblr girl, but Sherlock may be my favorite piece of media of all time. 
    The world's most famous "consulting detective" is thrust into modern day London, solving murders and going toe-to-toe with his most 
    infamous arch-nemeses. Of course, where would Sherlock Holmes be without his partner, Dr. John Watson, recently returned from Afghanistan and 
    craving danger and adventure? Each time I watch an episode, I discover more and more hidden intricacies, interweaving into the most 
    brilliant, clever, and satisfying storylines. This is heavily boistered by the charismatic performance of Benedict Cumberbatch 
    (Benadryl Cucumber?) and his chemistry with Martin Freeman. From "A Study in Pink" to "The Final Problem": the game is on. 
</p>

<h3>2. BoJack Horseman (2014-2020)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/bojack-stars.jpg" alt="bojack horseman outside observatory" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>adult animation, black comedy, drama</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "You were born broken. That's your birthright. 
        And now, you can fill your life with projects, your books, and your movies and your little girlfriends, but it won't make you whole. 
        You're BoJack Horseman. There's no cure for that." 
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    Only this show can make you cry from lines uttered by an alcoholic horse. The eponymous character is a washed-up actor, 
    addicted to pills, alcohol, and sex. His jaded and cynical tendencies strain every relationship he has, to the point of complete destruction.
    I both love and hate this show for its portrayal of mental illness and abuse, while still maintaining BoJack is <i>not</i> the hero of the story, 
    no matter how many times he admits he is broken. 
    At the same time, the comedic beats and witty, snappy dialogue of each episode nearly balances out the tragedy, strengthened by 
    fantastic character-building and animation. 
</p>

<h3>3. Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba (2019-current)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/demon-slayer.jpg" alt="Inosuke and Tanjiro on Mugen train" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>anime, adventure, dark fantasy</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "No matter how many people you may lose, you have no choice but to go on living. No matter how devastating the blows."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

<p>
    My interest in anime was revived with this show. I didn't expect much: Tanjiro is a young teenager living in a world of 
    ever-powerful demons. When his sister-turned-demon is the only survivor his family's slaughter, he trains as a Demon Slayer 
    and vows to change his sister back. I'm not normally interested in fantasy, but the animation hooked me immediately. 
    The demons are grotesque; each Slayer's fighting style is crisp, gorgeous, and a complete masterpiece to watch. 
    Every arc, from Mugen Train to the Entertainment District, elevates the one before it, resulting in dazzling fight scenes 
    and haunting screams. A nightmare worthy of binging, even if you don't like anime. 
</p>

<h3>4. Mad Men (2007-2015)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/peggy-office.png" alt="Peggy carrying supplies in McCan hallway" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>period drama</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "One minute you're on top of the world, the next minute some secretary's running you over with a lawn mower."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

<p>
    Away from the action comes Mad Men, an slower-paced examination of American advertisement execs in the 1960s. 
    Among the ensemble cast include: Don Draper, the enigmatic creative director; Peggy Olson, his secretary-turned-protégé; 
    Pete Campbell, an ambitious young account exec; and Joan Holloway, the attractive office manager with more influence than meets the eye. 
    The accuracy of old American culture, fashion, politics, power dynamics, social movements, and technology draws you into the decade, 
    and missing one second means missing lovingly-added details that make scenes come alive. 
    I'm not much for symbolism and cinematic interpretation, but I still enjoyed the every minute. 
</p>

<h3>5. Kakegurui (2017-2019)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/kakegurui-yumeko.png" alt="Yumeko with red eyes" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>anime, psycological thriller, drama</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "Instead of living on in ignorance, wouldn't you rather die, knowing everything?"
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

<p>
    The premise of Kakegurui sounds like your typical high school anime, except for one thing: 
    each student's money, status, and even life is wagered in school-wide gambling. 
    Enter Yumeko Jabami, a self-proclaimed "compulsive gambler" seeking to topple the student council president, who controls the school. 
    The games and battles remind me of <i>Sherlock</i> and <i>No Game, No Life</i>: just when you think you know the answer, 
    it shifts into something else entirely. Accompanying this is terrifying animation: quick-cuts turning cutesy school-girls 
    into something a little more salacious, and a lot more disturbing. 
    Watch it or not, but at least check out the coolest intro ever: "<a href="https://youtu.be/Lb3Q5WwogFg" target="_blank">Deal with the Devil.</a>"
</p>

<h3>6. Fleabag (2016-2019)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/fleabag-confession.png" alt="Fleabag in confession" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>black comedy, comedy-drama</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "I want someone to tell me what to wear every morning. 
        I want someone to tell me what to eat. What to like, what to hate, what to rage about, what to listen to, what band to like, 
        what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. 
        I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them. 
        I just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life, Father, because so far I think I've been getting it wrong."
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    It's hard describing this show without spoiling the plot, but! We follow a young woman in London, known only as Fleabag, 
    as she struggles through loss, depression, and anger towards the world. Only a handful of characters are given names, 
    but every one of them impacts her, for better or for worse.  
    Part of this show's charm comes from its deft approach in breaking the fourth wall: 
    you, the audience, become Fleabag's parter-in-confidence, exposed to her thoughts and experiences as if they were your own. 
    Of course, this makes it all the more heartbreaking. 
</p>

<h3>7. You (2018-current)</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="/assets/images/blog/blog-post/tv-recs/you-joe.png" alt="silhouette in front of glass cage" style="max-width:95%">
    <p>Genre: <i>psychological thriller</i></p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
        "You know why this is happening? Because while I was seeing you, really seeing you, you were busy gazing at a fantasy. 
        A perfectly imperfect girl. Saw what you wanted to see, but I was always right here the whole time. It wasn't that hard. 
        You just had to look." 
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p>
    I think everyone under the sun (and with access to Netflix) has seen this show.
    But, for those who haven't: Joe Goldberg is an obsessive psychopath who views his chosen women as something he needs to love and protect, 
    at any cost. He considers himself an old-fashioned romantic, emulating the charismatic heroes of classic literature, all the while 
    stalking and killing anyone who gets in the way. It's dangerous, and the popularity of Joe, much like BoJack, speaks to the 
    common romanticization of protagonists, regardless of the monstrous things they do. 
    I consider the first three seasons the best - the charm of old New York, warm haze of LA, and cold emptiness of suburbia set stage to 
    a thrilling story both tightly written and scarily probable.
