<p>
    In the months leading up to my earning of a mathematics degree, a labor of four years and endless amounts of chai, 
    I often contemplated the identity and experiences of a self-proclaimed mathematician. 
    Most often, I examined the patterns of language which, at first, was foreign: formal definitions, common styles of proof, 
    vocabulary and phrases adopted by professors and not yet learned by their young students. 
</p>

<p>
    By the end, I had a much better grasp on this unfamiliarity, this "secret language." 
    I have no doubt that my command of it seems elementary to the most tenured of professors, or most dedicated of PhD candidates. 
    But for my non-math friends, my non-STEM family, it remains a mystery (or utter gibberish). 
    I like to think this knowledge validates my status as a mathematician, knowing I will likely never return to a life of academia.
</p>

<p>
    With this in mind, I wanted to write a post about this mathematical language. 
    I don't yet know whether my purpose lies in maintaining that knowledge base, 
    or providing a perspective to those completely disengaged from the field. 
    I also recognize my experience is limited: I only took undergraduate math classes, focused soley on discrete mathematics, 
    and turned my nose up at a lifetime of reading academic journals. 
    Regardless, reader, I hope you enjoy my ramblings on this subject. 
</p>

<h2>A Crash Course on Proofs</h2>

<p>
    My only exposure to proofs pre-university was in freshman year geometry. There, proof rules were simple: 
    parallel lines, perpendicular bisectors of circles, anything that could easily be wrapped up in a nice, simple statement. 
    The proofs themselves, looking back, were laughable. Each "proof step" amounted to an angle being equal to another, or 
    two shapes being congruent. 
</p>

<p>
    I can assure you it is not the same in higher-level mathematics. 
</p>

<p>
    The foundation of my proof-writing skills came in the form of MATH 230: Introduction to Discrete Mathematics. 
    Propositional logic, induction, proof by contradiction -- all were new terms, swirling around, recognizable 
    as an integral part of any mathematical field yet so elusive. It took a while to master not only the mechanical step-by-step 
    proofs, but also the ebb and flow of more complex ones. 
</p>

<h3>What is a proof?</h3>

<p>
    Well, it's an explanation that seeks to prove something. For example, the product of two even integers is always even, 
    or there are infinitely many prime numbers. 
</p>

<p>
    But it is not smart to prove these statements exhaustively. You can't simply write down a table of every possible 
    combination of two even numbers, or a list of all the primes. It has to be more clever than that: represent "something" 
    generally, and prove something about that generality. 
</p>

<p>
    Look at that first example: "the product of two even numbers is always even." Any small amount of experimentation 
    and you might conclude this property with ease. Any 1st grader could do it. But formally, let's consider: 
</p>
<!-- 
<div style="text-align: center;"> -->
    <ol>
        <li>All even integers have the form <i>2k</i>, where <i>k</i> is an integer.</li> Convince yourself of this. 
        <li>Let us have two even numbers, <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>.</li>
        <li>By (1), then <i>m = 2k</i> and <i>n = 2l</i>, where <i>k, l</i> are integers.</li>
        <li>Thus, <i>mn = (2k)(2l) = 4(kl) = 2(2kl)</i>.</li>
        <li>Since <i>k, l</i> are integers, then clearly <i>2kl</i> is also an integer.</li>
        <li>By (1) again, it follows that <i>mn</i> is an even number.</li>
    </ol>
<!-- </div> -->

<p>
    This might have been obvious, or not. I don't know your background. 
    But this is a great introductory example to the style of a <i>direct proof.</i>
</p>

<p>
    Yes, there are different techniques. Even more fun: many statements can be prove with different techniques, 
    or a combination of them. Here's a small list (skip if you want): 
</p>

<h4>Direct proof:</h4> 

<p> You prove <i>a -> b (a implies b)</i> directly. Translation: if statement <i>a</i> is true, it <i>must</i> follow statement <i>b</i> is true. </p>
        
<h4>Proof by Contrapositive:</h4> 
<p>
    The statement <i>a -> b</i> is logically equivalent to its contrapositive:<i>~b -> ~a (not b implies not a)</i>. 
    Translation: if <i>b</i> is false, it follows that <i>a</i> is false.
    Proving the contrapositive is the same as proving the original statement, and vice versa.
    Proceed to prove <i>~b -> ~a</i>. 
</p>

<h4> Proof by Contradiction:</h4> 

<p>
    We want to prove <i>a -> b</i>. Instead, let's assume <i>by contradiction</i>
    that <i>a is true</i> and <i>b is false</i>: we somehow cannot prove <i>b</i>. 
    Take these assumptions and logically arrive at a contradiction. 
    Because your steps are logical, then the only problem must have been that you assumed <i>b is false</i>. Thus, <i>b is true.</i>
</p>

<h4>Proof by Cases:</h4> 
    
<p>
    Say we want to prove something about a large group, like a property of all integers. We can split 
    this group into a series of <i>cases</i>, like even and odd integers, or negative and non-negative integers. 
    We prove the statement (whatever it is) for every case type. Notably, taking all these cases would comprise the whole space, so 
    proving something about each case should prove the property for everything. This is an exhaustive approach, but only has a finite 
    number of cases.
</p>

<h4>Proof by Induction:</h4>
<p>
    You want to prove a property which applies to an infinite number of "things." You can't do it directly. But those "things" 
    are somehow related to each other. Maybe proving the property for 
    one "thing" can help you prove the property for another "thing", in a very systematic way. 
</p>

<p>
    Suppose you want to prove this property about positive intgers: 1, 2, 3....
    You could start with proving the property for 1. 
    If you prove the property for 1, you notice you can prove it for 2. 
    If you prove the property for 2, you notice you can prove it for 3. 
    Eventually, you might realize that this applies very nicely to any integer: if you can prove 
    the thing about an integer <i>k</i>, you can somehow prove it for the integer <i>k+1</i>. 
    All you have to do is prove the very first case, and then prove the general "rule" moving from <i>k</i> to <i>k+1</i>. 
</p>

<p>
    In this fashion, generalizing allows you to prove the property for an <i>infinite</i> amount of <i>k's</i>. 
    For this example, you've proved it about EVERY single positive integer. 
</p>

<p>
    If we squint a little, this is the theory behind proof by induction. 
    First, you have to prove one case, the "base case." 
    Assume that your property is true for some case <i>k</i>, which is your induction hypothesis. 
    In the inductive step, you use that assumption <i>k</i> to show the property is true for the "next" case, <i>k+1</i>. 
</p>

<p>
    Since we never specify a specific <i>value</i> for <i>case k</i>, as long as our logic is correct and consistent, 
    we have proved something more general for every infinite number of "things." 
</p>

<h3>Predictable or not?</h3>

<p>
    Make no mistake, this list was a tip of the iceberg. There are so many diferent ways to show things: some 
    interesting, some not.
</p>

<p> 
    Many proof styles have a form, of some sort. In Proof by Contradiction, 
    you'd naturally start out with: "Assume to the contrary that...", and in Proof by Induction, 
    you'll want to show your base case, your induction hypothesis, and your inductive step. 
</p>

<p>
    Maybe the average freshman will take these pointers and mechanically go through each step, eventually 
    arriving at their conclusion. There are certainly proofs that require no elegance -- they are straight-forward enough, 
    nothing more than a simple homework problem to test your understanding. 
</p>


<p>
    But simple memorization of a bunch of proofs and their techniques can only get you so far. Furthermore, 
    regurgitation is not how discovery in mathematics is made: it is through creativity and intuition. 
    Proof tools are nothing more what they are: tools, not talent. 
</p>

<h2>Patterns and Flows of Proofs</h2>

<p>
    In higher-level courses, I've often heard professors call a proof or theory "elegant." What does that really mean? 
</p>

<p>
    To this, I can offer no concrete explanation. But after years of studies, one begins to identify if a flow makes sense, 
    if it is natural, if it is beautiful. This is not something taught in books, but gained through exposure. 
</p>

<p>
    Mathematicians pick up and integrate phrases into their work. "Let's assume that," "By this theorem," 
    "Let x be," "Without loss of generality" -- all are common things you might find in any introductory (or not so introductory) textbook. 
    Putting these phrases together into someting cohesive requires intuition beyond the textbook. 
</p>

<p>
    It is not that complex to think about. Any native English speaker picks up on acceptable rules 
    of their language without not quite knowing why it is acceptable. An <a src="https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/ao04n8/word_order_makes_a_difference/">
    old Tumblr post</a> explains it well: we have an unspoken rule on adjective precedence. 
    "Big brown dog" makes sense, while "brown big dog" makes us uneasy. 
</p>

<p>
    The very same thing applies to mathematics. Elegant proofs must not only be logically correct, and use the right
    terminology, but also <i>satisfy.</i> It should not be clunky, innefficient, confusing, or violate 
    any unwritten rules about proof-writing.
