description: "Objectively, the best books to read, ever"
--- 

<p>
    I was the type of kid who read at least one book a day. 
</p> 

<p>
    I've always loved reading. Librarians knew me by name, 
    and my parents always knew what to get me for Christmas. I stayed up way too late, just trying to finish the next chapter. 
    In the car at night, I stole lines from passing streetlights. 
</p>

<p>
    Nowadays, I don't read as much as I want to. College takes up a lot of my time. 
    But these books hold a special place in my heart: maybe they will for you, too.

            "Friendship, companionship: it so often defied logic, so often eluded the deserving, so often settled itself 
            on the odd, the bad, the peculiar, the damaged."

    <i>Bookworm's Commentary:</i>
    Running at 800+ pages, this visceral novel is more of a character study than anything else. 
    It follows the life of Jude, a broken and enigmatic man haunted by his past, and his circle of friends in 
    New York. Some view it as a masterpiece; others call it misery porn. I'm of the former opinion. 
    It explores the nature of friendship, abuse, love, addiction, art, and what it means to be painfully human. 
    It is the most beautiful book I've ever read, and also the most heartbreaking. Read at your own risk.

        "Those few seconds in which parts of her mind came to a halt were not trivial in their effect on her. There was 
        trauma, loss, change; she was not now the same being she was before. Parts of her had died. 
        Parts of her had become confused, out of order... She discovered, as many a living being had discovered, 
        that rational decisions are far more easily made than carried out."

    <i>Bookworm's Commentary:</i>
    I started this book as a sci-fi hater; in fact, the only reason I read it was because a friend recommended Ender's Game. 
    Ender's Game was alright, but I heard the sequel was better. Indeed, it was: I poured through the pages, 
    entranced by Ender's journey to Lusitania. The mystery of the 'piggies', the descolada virus, and a sentient 
    super-powered AI capable of instantaneous communication across light-years? I've never been as hooked.

    4. <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>, Norton Juster
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>children's fantasy</i>
    </p>
</div>

    <blockquote cite="">
        <p>
            "It's very much like your trying to reach infinity. You know that it's there, you just don't know where. 
            But just because you can never reach it doesn't mean it's not worth looking for."

    <i>Bookworm's Commentary:</i>
    This book serves as a love letter to the pursuit of knowledge. Whenever things get difficult, I turn to this book and 
    rediscover the joy of learning. It stars Milo, a boy who "[regards] the process of seeking knowledge as the 
    greatest waste of time," and his journey to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason.  
    Clever and witty, this novel shines brighter the City of Illusions, sings sweeter than the Symphony of Color, and 
    will definitely bring you out of the Doldrums.

<h3>
    5. <i>American Gods</i>, Neil Gaiman
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>fantasy</i>
    </p>
</div>

    <blockquote cite="">

            "Gods die. And when they truly die, they are unmourned and unremembered.
            Ideas are more difficut to kill than people, but they can be killed, in the end."

    <i>Bookworm's Commentary:</i>
    Shadow Moon, having just served his prison sentence, re-enters the world and finds his wife dead and a stranger 
    offering him a mysterious job. He is whisked across America, caught on the edge of a war between the Old Gods 
    and the New Gods.
    As an avid traveler, but also as someone who grew up in the middle of nowhere, the pages hit deep, and hard. 
    Gray winters in small towns, jukebox bars, gleaning cities, broken-down apartments in Chi, sea breeze in SF: 
    Gaiman captured 21 years of my feelings in a single novel. It's bittersweet and deliciously dark.
