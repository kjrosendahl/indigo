    With the Flint, Michigan crisis, the world has become more wary of the 
    <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water' target="_blank">dangers of ingesting lead</a>, commonly found in paint and tap water. 
    Impairment in child development, damage to the cardiovascular system, decreased central functions: list goes on and on.
    Lead in drinking water comes from absorption from lead pipes, called Lead Service Lines (LSLs). 
    In 1986, the 
    <a href='https://www.epa.gov/water-research/technical-support-water-infrastructure' target="_blank">creation of all new LSLs</a>
     were banned by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and cities were directed to replace them with safer pipes made of copper.
</p>

<p>
    Chicago had an estimated 400,000 LSLs supplying water to its citizens, and has until 2077 to replace all of them. 
    The question is: why have they 
    <a href='https://chicago.suntimes.com/2022/12/2/23488902/lead-water-service-line-replacement-chicago' target='_blank'>
        only replaced 280 lines</a>, as of December 2022? Moreover, why are so few Chicagoans aware of this problem? 
    How is this affecting our city?

    In Spring 2023, I led a team of IIT students to investigate this issue. This was through MATH 497: Special Problems in Business, 
    Government, and Industry, run by <a href='http://math.iit.edu/~rellis/' target='_blank'>Professor Robert B. Ellis</a>
    of the Applied Mathematics department. The class was 
    credited as an "Interprofessional Project" (IPRO) course, which are designed for students of different majors to
    solve problems related to technology, health, community, and innovation. 
</p>

<p>
    The Peanut Butter Hunters (PBH) spent the semester exploring data released by Chicago on lead levels in drinking water. 
     With statistical analysis, data science techniques, and geo-spatial visualization, we concluded 
    there was, indeed, a lead crisis in the city.

<p>
    Here is our research, which won us the runner-up title in the Health and Community Tract at IPRO day. 
    We were also advised by 
    <a href='https://safewaterengineering.com/' target="_blank">
        Elin Betanzo</a>, a water engineer who founded Safe Water Engineering and worked on the Flint crisis. 
    I am forever grateful for the guidance of Professor Ellis and Ms. Betanzo; without them, we wouldn't have discovered 
    such devastating results.

<h3>The History</h3>

<p>
    As stated earlier, LSLs weren't banned until 1986; any residences built before then likely have LSLs servicing their water. 
    In 1991, the EPA set a federal regulation called the 
    <a href='https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/lead-and-copper-rule' target='_blank'>Lead and Copper Rule</a> (LCR): 
    no more than 10% of water samples could exceed 15 parts per billion (ppb) of lead, the Lead Action Level (LAL). 
    Otherwise, the EPA and the city must take action. 
</p>

<p>
    In 2022, Chicago 
    <a href='https://www.chicago.gov/content/dam/city/depts/water/ConsumerConfidenceReports/2022_WaterQualityReport.pdf'>
        reported a 90th percentile of 6.8 ppb</a>; 
        <i>technically</i>, they are in compliance with the LCR. We find several issues with this yearly procedure: 
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chicago is only required to test 50 households, a mere .0045% of total residences. Under the LCR, up to five households 
            could have had more than 15 ppb. 
        </li>
        <li>There's evidence the city only <a href='https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-chicago-water-lead-contamination-20180411-htmlstory.html' target="_blank"> 
            tests households of employees who work for the Chicago Department of Water Management</a> (CDWM).</li>
        <li>Current procedures use samples from the 
            <a href='https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/documents/LCR_Sample_Form.pdf' target='_blank'>
                1st liter drawn from your tap</a>. This may not be the most representative of your 
            average lead level, since it takes time for water to travel from the street main pipe (possibly an LSL) into your residence. 
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    Although the first two factors are unlikely to change anytime soon, the issue of using 1st liter draws may soon be mitigated. 
    In October 2024, the EPA will start enforcing the 
    <a href='https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/revised-lead-and-copper-rule' target="_blank">Lead and Copper Rule Revision</a> (LCRR): 
    rather than taking the 1st liter as the sample, they will take the 5th liter sample. 
    We would expect that the later draw indicates lead levels more accurately. 
    It's unknown whether Chicago will still be in compliance under the LCRR.

</div>

<p>
    The PBH were interested in ALL lead results reported by the city within the last few years - not just these 50 households. 
    Although uncommon knowledge, any Chicago resident is eligible to 
    <a href='https://www.chicagowaterquality.org/home' target="_blank">test their lead for free</a>,
     a service provided by CDWM. 
    They may request a lead testing kit or schedule an appointment for a CDWM employee to test it for them. 
    The initial testing kit instructs 1st liter draws, but some households may perform follow-up <i>sequential testing</i>, in which 
    10 1-liter draws are taken in a row. 
</p>

<p>
    Our research focused on the results from sequential testing. We examined how well the 1st draw represents a household's lead levels, or the current method. 
    Using the 1st and 5th draws of the sequential results, we also compared the effectiveness of the LCRR's procedure in representing lead over the LCR. 
    Finally, we investigated the relationship between low income and high lead levels.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="https://www.chicagowaterquality.org/home#results " target="_blank">data we used in this research</a> 
    is public information, released by the CDWM. <a href='https://www.cookcountyassessor.com/community-data' target='_blank'>
        Data on all Chicago households</a>, such as price, income, and location, was 
    retrieved from the Cook County Assessor's Office.
