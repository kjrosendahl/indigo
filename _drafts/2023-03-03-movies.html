    I'm not the biggest cinephile on the planet - it's hard for me to sit through a movie and not get distracted.
</p>

<p>
    Regardless, there are a few movies I consider better than others.
    Read more about them here! 
</p>

<h3>
    1. <i>Clue</i> (1985)
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/clue.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto" alt="clue movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>mystery, black comedy</i>
    </p>
</div>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Do you miss him?"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="border-left: .3rem solid #cccccc">
        <p>
            "Well, it's a matter of life after death. Now that he's dead, I have a life."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "But he was your second husband. Your first husband also disappeared."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="border-left: .3rem solid #cccccc">
        <p>
            "That was his job. He was an illusionist."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "But he never reappeared!"
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="border-left: .3rem solid #cccccc">
        <p>
            "He wasn't a very good illusionist."
        </p>

    13 year old me loved this movie; 21 year old me loves it even more. Based on the game, six strangers are invited to mysterious dinner party.
    The one thing they have in common? They're all being blackmailed. Of course, things go a little awry when the lights go out and their host, the blackmailer, is murdered.
    With dark humor and double entendres, this film captured my heart. 
</p>

<h3>
    2. <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-verse</i> (2018)
</h3>

<div class="text-center"> 
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/spider-verse.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto"  alt="spiderverse movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>action, adventure, animated</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "I don't think my atoms are real jazzed about being in the wrong dimension."
        </p>

<p>
    Perhaps the most gorgeously animated movie in history. Watching <i>Into the Spider-verse</i> on the big screen left me breathless: 
    the vivid color schemes, lines and hatches, blends of art styles, double-vision frames, electricity, crisp motions... 
    Not only is it visually stunning, but it shattered my expectations for being a mere 'animated movie.' I will never tire of watching it. 
</p>

<h3>
    3. <i>Knives Out</i> (2019), <i>Glass Onion</i> (2022)
</h3>

<div class="text-center"> 
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/knives-out.jpg" alt="knives out and glass onion movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>mystery</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "I feel a noose tightening. The family is truly desperate. Desperate motives, 
            with the mystery of who hired me, the impossibility of the crime... and yet, a doughnut."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</figure>

<p>
    Whether detective Benoit Blanc is investigating a suspicious death and a dysfunctional family, or a murder on a private 
    remote island, one thing ties the cases together: an outlandish Southern accent. Both Knives Out and its standalone sequel, The Glass Onion, 
    boast colorful ensemble casts, witty jokes, and twisting mysteries. Can't wait for the third film. 
</p>

<h3>
    4. <i>Baby Driver</i> (2017)
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/baby-driver.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto"  alt="baby driver movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>action, crime drama</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>

<p>
    Because who can function without the perfect playlist? Follow Baby, a near-mute getaway driver sucked into a life of 
    crime to pay off his debts. He uses music to escape this morally gray area, and if you're anything like me? 
    You'll find Baby awkwardly charismatic and the soundtrack even more so. 
</p>

<h3>
    5. <i>Coraline</i> (2009)
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/coraline.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto"  alt="coraline movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>stop motion, dark fantasy, horror</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "Black is traditional, but if you prefer pink, or vermilion, or chartruese... 
            though you might make me jealous."
        </p>
    </blockquote>

<p> 
    Coraline is a girl seeking excitement - so why shouldn't she travel through a portal to the Other World, where its occupants have sewn buttons for eyes? 
    Despite being scarred for life, my sister and I watched this movie at least every two weeks as kids. 
    With lovingly-created stop-motion animation and a compelling story, I highly recommend - as long as you're not scared of the dark. 
</p>

<h3>
    6. <i>(500) Days of Summer</i> (2009)
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/500-days.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto" alt="500 days of summer movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>rom-com, drama</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote style="border-left: .3rem solid #cccccc">
        <p>
            "Look, we don't have to put a label on it. That's fine. I get it. But, you know, 
            I just... I need some consistency."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "I know."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote style="border-left: .3rem solid #cccccc">
        <p>
            "I need to know that you're not going to wake up in the morning and feel differently."
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "And I can't give you that. Nobody can."

    In a non-linear timeline, discover the beginning, middle, and end of the relationship between Tom and the eponymous Summer. 
    One is a hopeless romantic, while the other doesn't believe in love. I found this film bittersweet, reminiscient of a time I 
    can no longer remember. And yet, I was still drawn to it, despite how heartbreaking.

<h3>
    7. <i>Good Will Hunting</i> (1997)
</h3>

<div class="text-center">
    <img src="../assets/images/blog/blog-post/movie-recs/good-will-hunting.jpg" style="max-width: 60%; height:auto" alt="good will hunting movie poster">
    <p>
        Genre: <i>drama</i>
    </p>
</div>

<figure>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            "So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. 
            Michaelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? 
            But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. 
            If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. 
            But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. 
            And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? 'Once more unto the breach, dear friends.' 
            But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. 
            I'd ask you about love, and you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable."

<p>
    Troubled, brilliant, cocky, misguided - who is Will Hunting? Haunted by his past and self-sabotaging, Will finds himself head-to-head 
    with a psychologist determined to help him. I love this movie for its power: monologues and quips, introspection and quietly shifting moments. 
    Try it out; you'll never be the same.
