    I'm not the biggest cinephile on the planet - it's hard for me to sit through a movie and not get distracted.
</p>

<p>
    Regardless, there are a few movies I grew to love (or loved immediately). 
    Read more about them here!

        <p>
            "So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written. 
            Michaelangelo, you know a lot about him. Life's work, political aspirations, him and the pope, sexual orientations, the whole works, right? 
            But I'll bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine chapel. You've never actually stood there and looked at that beautiful ceiling; seen that. 
            If I ask you about women, you'd probably give me a syllabus about your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. 
            But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. 
            And I'd ask you about war, you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? 'Once more unto the breach, dear friends.' 
            But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help. 
            I'd ask you about love, and you'd probably quote me a sonnet. But you've never looked at a woman and been totally vulnerable."
