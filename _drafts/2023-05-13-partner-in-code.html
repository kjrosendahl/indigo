<p>
a year has passed, my darling - 
<br>
but that's not right, is it? 
<br>
for you were never quite mine, 
<br>
though your heart beat too fast 
<br>
just for me, 
<br>
and you searched for the stars 
<br>
with me, 
<br>
and you held me in your arms 
<br>
until I fell asleep. 
<br>
and yet, I still write poetry,
<br>
write unsent letters, 
<br>
play songs on repeat 
<br>
with the hope of keeping you alive, 
<br>
close, 
<br>
ever-so-bright, 
<br>
like the time bled, 
<br>
like those dog-days, 
<br>
the first time I ever wanted forever. 
<br>
how can I enter those same 
<br>
oppressing 
<br>
suffocating 
<br>
months 
<br>
without someone to breathe life back into me? 
<br>
the chalk-streaked fingers, 
<br>
carefully smudging my skin, 
<br>
christening,
<br>
or tracing my elegant wrists 
<br>
like beautiful code, 
<br>
our bodies curving together 
<br>
in sticky heat. 
<br>
I can't hear lapping waves 
<br>
without tasting strawberries - 
<br>
the sugary fructose 
<br>
keeping sweat at bay - 
<br>
and without feeling sandy grit 
<br>
between our skin, 
<br>
as I swayed on your shoulders, 
<br>
your bony frame the only thing 
<br>
between me and the ground. 
<br>
maybe I loved you, 
<br>
or maybe I had sun-tinted glasses, 
<br>
but your soft r's 
<br>
and non-existent h's 
<br>
echo when I read your inscription 
<br>
for the hundredth time. 
<br>
I blush at our magnetism, 
<br>
which seemed unavoidable, 
<br>
and dream of a life 
<br>
where everything is back 
<br>
the way it was. 
<br>
endlessly waiting for you 
<br>
in my abandoned, glowing room, 
<br>
and endlessly recieiving you.
