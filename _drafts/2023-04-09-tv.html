<!-- Sherlock, bojack horseman, demon slayer, madmen, kakegurui, fleabag, you -->

<p>
    Rounding out the entertainment trifecta: my favorite TV shows. I've rewatched most of these multiple times, often 
    late at night, freshly showered and curled up in bed. Shall we begin?

        what to buy tickets for, what to joke about, what not to joke about. 
        I want someone to tell me what to believe in, who to vote for, and who to love, and how to tell them.

        You just had to look."
