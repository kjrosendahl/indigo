description: "Flying solo at a women's mathematics conference"
--- 

<p>
    A few posts ago, I discussed my week at JMM and my implicit sense of belonging in a world of mathematicians. 
    Last weekend, I once again hopped on a plane (at an ungodly hour) to present my summer research at the 
    <a href="https://math.unl.edu/ncuwm" target="_blank">Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics</a> (NCUWM). 
    Unlike JMM, this time it was solo: I was the only teammate presenting. Also unlike JMM: that belonging was more explicit. 
</p>

<p>
    Let me give you the stats. 
    It was the 25th anniversary of NCUWM. 
    About 250 people attended. 
    Of those, 100 students presented research in a talk or poster. 
    It was held Friday-Sunday, in the Embassy Suites in Lincoln, NE.
</p>

<p>
    As you can imagine, it was a significantly smaller conference, and much more intimate. 
</p>

<p>
    The official theme this year was "Inspiring Women for Generations." Yet, with plenty of panels, 
    plenaries, and sessions, it was clear the conference sought to make mathematical spaces more inclusive and accessible overall. 
    Invited speakers discussed mentoring, community, engaging the public, opportunities, being a minority in mathematics, 
    and of course, being a woman in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
    I'll be honest. Despite being a female minority in a STEM field, I've never thought my race or gender had become
    detrimental to my work, or my experiences growing up. Maybe I'm lucky: I always hear about 
    micro-aggressions, or women having to earn respect they already deserved, and there's no doubt of blatant 
    rasicm and sexism in professional spaces. Or maybe I'm not that observant: maybe I considered 
    any hesitancy or self-doubt a result of my personality, rather than some intrinsic identity. 
</p>

<p>
    I've never felt out of place in a room full of male peers. I doubt I've actively noticed - maybe just passively. 
    Call it overconfidence, or call it lack of awareness. In the end, when I listened to others share their 
    frustrations and experiences as not just women, but as women mathematicians? It left me wondering: 
    when, if at all, will I find myself in the same position? Am I too callous, or have the spaces I've been in always 
    been inclusive? 
</p>

<p>
    For now, and especially at the conference, I'll just sit back and listen. 
</p>

    <i>On the Inspirational</i>
</p>

<p>
    I'm not a huge fan of motivational talks, or discussions about "community" and "belonging."
    While finding people you connect with and care about is imperative, especially 
    for incredibly social creatures like humans, an hour talk on <i>why</i> it's important begins to feel preachy. 
    For me, there's a fine line between an inspirational spark and a didactic lecture. 
</p>

<p>
    I attended quite a few events which toed that line that weekend. 
    Many of them were plenaries and panels, on discovering your mentors, advice, finding that community. 
    That's not to insult the speakers: all of them were brilliant mathematicians, with a passion for advancing 
    those spaces in math (and the work and experience to prove it). It just wasn't for me; however, I'm sure 
    plenty found it empowering. 
</p> 

<p>
    <i>On Graduate School</i>
</p>

<p>
    At conferences, it's not a matter of whether you're going into academia or industry. It's a matter of which graduate school,
    pure math or applied math, research or teaching. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm not interested in academia. While I love math, I don't want it to be my entire life. 
    I don't want to stress about quals, or the two body problem. 
    The decision was easy; attending conferences in spite of that decision is not. 
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate: each talk I attended encouraged you to attend grad school. It wasn't malicious, or pretentious; rather, 
    they saw it as an opportunity many students failed to take out of fear. Nearly every attendee 
    held a PhD, or was studying for one, or dreamed of pursuing one. 
</p>

<p>
    Needless to say, I skipped the plenary "Picking a Graduate School."
</p>

<hr>

<p>
    So, what parts <i>did</i> I enjoy? 
    If you read my post on JMM, you'll recall I found beauty and belonging in the quiet moments. 
    It was subtle: the mathematical art, the smiles, the humor. 
</p>

<p>
    In Lincoln, I didn't care for the large talks - it felt disconnected, like I was a spectator, meant to 
    clap at the right times and chuckle at the right jokes. 
    Instead, I found comfort in the more personal moments: dinner conversations, or breakout sessions. 
    They were led by professors or invited guests, with a quality of vulnerability I didn't expect. 
    Unlike JMM, it didn't take days afterwards to convince myself I belonged. It was instantaneous. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        On Imposter Syndrome
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    Dinner on Friday was held in a grand ballroom, each piece of silverware and folded napkins placed perfectly. 
    Halfway through, four professors sat at the front stage for the panel of the evening: "Random Bits of Advice." 
    Most of it was standard: personal stories, how to advocate for yourself, balancing having a family and a career. 
    Then, one student asked how they overcame imposter syndrome.
</p>

<p>
    I didn't hear this phrase until high school - and when I did, I'd never heard anything that described me more. 
    Although I've improved since then, I sometimes think: when will I fail? 
    When will everyone I know realize I'm not as skilled, or talented, as I seem? 
</p>

<p>
    After a moment of heavy silence, one professor slowly leaned in and said: "I don't think I ever did. I've 
    accomplished all I've ever wanted in my career. And I still ask myself: when will I be found out?"
</p>

<p>
    It may be a mistake to view your professors as inherently infallible. Deep down, I know they aren't. They're human, 
    just like anyone else. But I've never considered me to be like them, or them like me. 
    To hear the speaker admit this, despite her achievements, almost validated my own struggles. 
    I felt a little at ease, however small and fleeting. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        On Making Mistakes
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    I almost skipped the breakout sessions Saturday afternoon. 
    It had been a long day, but one of the talks ran over and I didn't have time to escape 
    to my hotel. I walked into a conference room, where three professors were hosting a session "Overcoming the Confidence Gap."
</p>

<p>
    I'll spare most of the details; I'm sure you can guess. What stood out to me were our hosts. 
    They glanced over their papers and grimaced; I assumed the talking points were too on the nose. 
    Instead, they asked questions and listened intently. 
</p>

<p>
    As the discussion turned to insecurities, and imposter syndrome again, they shared stories. About 
    misakes they'd made, or things they didn't realize until much later in life. When a student shared their worry about 
    doing the wrong thing, one professor told us to close our eyes: "Imagine you're on a dating app. 
    Imagine everything you'd write about your 'perfect' partner. Looks, personality... now, think of the people you've dated before."
    The entire room erupted into laughter, yet she made her point. 
</p>

<p>
    That level of candidacy and gentleness wasn't something I'd really heard from a "proper" adult. 
    Maybe that's because I'm a student; you don't really consider the flaws and mistakes of your professors. 
    Still, the lines between "them" and "us" blurred just a little more. 
</p>

<p>
    <i>
        On Passion
    </i>
</p>

<p>
    And then came the networking dinner on Saturday night. In our packets, we were given bios of different speakers, grad students, 
    professors, or otherwise VIPs, and their assigned table number. The goal: rush to sit at the table you wanted and network. 
    Anxiety gnawed at me all day. I knew only one person that I wanted to speak with, because 
    she was the only one who worked in tech - as a SWE, as a product manager. 
    All the others, at some point or another, had interest in academia. 
</p>

<p>
    So I ran, and found her table, and I secured my spot. 
</p>

<p>
   As our table asked her questions, I listened raptly. She'd worked at Google, Microsoft, and Twitter - 
   as far as I was concerned, the perfect person to chat with. She was matter-of-fact, and brilliant, and told us explicitly, 
   "Only go to grad school if you truly want to." I laughed at her stories, and asked her advice for an interview I was 
   nervous about. 
</p>

<p>
    Ironically, as much as I dread networking, it was the best event I attended. Being able to talk to 
    someone who pursued industry, who knew what it was like to be a mathematician and also work in tech?
    Who didn't earn a PhD, who knew firsthand it wasn't for everyone?  
    Everywhere I went, grad school loomed over me, but this was a reprieve. 
    It felt safe. It felt meaningful. And with her humor and relatability, it was, quite simply, fun. 
</p>

<hr>

<p>
    What do all of these events have in common?
</p>

<p>
    They weren't scripted. I wasn't used to seeing academics be "real." 
    Be painfully human. When they broke into a long tangent, you could see the passion in their eyes, or their fears. 
    It made them more fleshed out. It's what connected all of us, deep down, at some fundamental level. 
</p>

<p>
    It wasn't always "inspirational," or even positive. That's not what mattered to me. It was the candor, the vulnerability. 
    You don't always see that in academia. 
</p>

<p>
    Having returned home, I haven't thought much about my weekend in Nebraska. I won't wax poetic about "connections" and 
    "meaningful relationships" - that's really not me. I don't often speak of my feelings; in fact, 
    these posts are the most personal things I've shared. 
</p>

<p>
    But someday, I'll be able to step back and remember a time I felt seen. Someday.
