<p>
    In all four years at college, I refused to use ChatGPT to write code or essays, unlike many of my peers. 
    I wanted to build a foundation of knowledge, and prided myself on personal creativity and growth. 
</p>

<p>
    Thus, being thrown into a world of generative AI, RAG, and prompt engineering soon into my first job came at quite a shock. 
</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/66degrees/posts/?feedView=all">66degrees</a> is a Google Cloud Partner organization, specializing 
    in technology and solutions consulting. 
    After graduation, I joined as a specialist transitioning to the AI/ML team come the end of the summer. 
    I had interned last summer, but this year had a massive focus on all things data science, machine learning, and genAI. 
</p>

<p>
    Along with onboarding, shadowing, and studying for Google's Professional Machine Learning Engineer Certification (I passed, by the way), 
    my team of two interns and two specialists (including me) was tasked with a small capstone project. 
    It served as a kickstart to one of the required projects tasked to 66degrees by Google, as way of keeping their Partner status.
    For us, it was a six week end-to-end engagement, and a way for us to experiment with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
