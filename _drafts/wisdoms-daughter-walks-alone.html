description: "Flying solo at a women's mathematics conference"
--- 

<p>
    In the last post, I discussed my week at JMM and my implicit sense of belonging in a world of mathematicians. 
    This last weekend, I once again hopped on a plane (at an ungodly hour) to present my summer research at the 
    <a href="https://math.unl.edu/ncuwm" target="_blank">Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics</a> (NCUWM). 
    Unlike JMM, this time it was solo: I was the only teammate presenting. Also unlike JMM: that belonging was more explicit. 
</p>

<p>
    Let me give you the stats. 
    It was the 25th anniversary of NCUWM. 
    About 230 students, invited speakers, and organizers attended. 
    Of those, about 100 undergraduates presented research in a talk or poster. 
    It was held Friday-Sunday, in the Embassy Suites in Lincoln, NE.
</p>

<p>
    So, as you can imagine, it was a significantly smaller conference, and much more intimate. 
</p>

<p>
    The official theme this year was "Inspiring Women for Generations." Yet, with plenty of panels, 
    plenaries, and breakout sessions, it was clear the conference sought to make mathematical spaces more inclusive and accessible overall. 
    Invited speakers discussed mentoring, community, engaging the public, confidence gaps, opportunities, being a minority in mathematics, 
    and of course, being a woman in mathematics.
</p>

<p>
    I'll be honest. Despite being a female minority in a STEM field, I've never thought my race or gender had become
    detrimental to my work, or my experiences growing up. Maybe I'm one of the lucky ones: I always hear about 
    micro-aggressions, or women having to earn respect they already deserved, and there's no doubt of blatant 
    rasicm and sexism in professional spaces. Or maybe I'm not that observant: maybe I considered 
    any hesitancy or self-doubt a result of my personality, rather than some intrinsic identity. 
</p>

<p>
    I've never felt out of place in a room full of male peers. I doubt I've actively noticed - maybe just passively. 
    Call it overconfidence, or call it lack of awareness. In the end, when I listened to others share their 
    frustrations and experiences as not just women, but as women mathematicians? It left me wondering: 
    when, if at all, will I find myself in the same position? Am I too callous, or have the spaces I've been in always 
    been inclusive? 
</p>

<p>
    For now, and especially at the conference, I'll just sit back and listen.

    <i>On the Inspirational</i>
</p>

<p>
    I'm not a huge fan of motivational talks, or discussions about "community" and "belonging". 
    While finding people you connect with and care about is imperative, especially 
    for incredibly social creatures like humans, an hour talk on <i>why</i> it's important begins to feel preachy. 
    For me, there's a fine line between an inspirational spark and a didactic lecture. 
</p>

<p>
    I attended quite a few events which toed that line that weekend. 
    Many of them were plenaries and panels, on discovering your mentors, advice, finding that community. 
    That's not to insult the speakers: all of them were brilliant mathematicians, with a passion for advancing 
    those spaces in math (and the work and experience to prove it). It just wasn't for me; however, I'm sure 
    plenty felt seen, and found it empowering.

    <i>On Graduate School</i>
</p>

<p>
    At conferences, it's not a matter of whether you're going into academia or industry. It's a matter of which graduate school,
    pure math or applied math, research or teaching. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm not interested in academia. While I love math, I don't want it to be my entire life. 
    I don't want to stress about quals, or the two body problem. 
    The decision was easy; attending conferences in spite of that decision is not. 
</p>

<p>
    To illustrate: each talk I attended encouraged you to pursue grad school. It wasn't malicious, or pretentious; rather, 
    they saw grad school as an opportunity many students failed to take out of fear. Nearly every invited speaker and guest 
    held a PhD, or was a graduate student. Of the students I talked to, every one of them dreamed of going to grad school. 
</p>
<!--panelists, "piece of advice", u-grad talks, plenaries, networking dinner
normally not into motivational shit, nor do I really consider my gender or race something that gets in my way
and I didn't enjoy the plenaries, or the panels much, because it feels like being talked to
-but I enjoyed things like the networking dinner, or the breakout sessions, or the vulnerabilities on the panel
unused to seeing academics, seeing people who you respect because of their academic status, being "real" and human
not the things that were scripted: the presentations, or the papers they recieved on topics to talk about
or even some of the questions some people asked
but when they ramble and you can clearly see their passion, or their fears, and it makes them more human
and it makes you feel more seen 
-> once again, hear a lot about grad school and math education and teaching and phds 
but at dinner -> being able to talk to people in industry, who feel safer talking to, who know what it's like to be 
a mathematician and also work in tech or as a swe?? missing that
