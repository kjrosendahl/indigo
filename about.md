      Hi, I'm Kaylee. Welcome to my site.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am a third year undergraduate student, studying Applied Mathematics and Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT), 
      located in Chicago, IL. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always had an affinity for STEM; I grew up fiddling with puzzles and solving any equation I could get my hands on. 
        Now, I explore the intersection of math and CS: algorithms and proofs, programming and logic, the concrete and the abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
      I plan on graduating with a Bachelor's in Applied Mathematics and a Master's in Computer Science. 
      I am currently doing research in applied statistics with
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/iit.edu/lulukang/" target="_blank">
        Professor Lulu Kang</a>.
      At IIT, I am the co-treasurer for Women in STEM, a student council member for the College of Computing, and circ member at Galvin Library.
