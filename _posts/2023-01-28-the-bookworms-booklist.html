description: "Objectively, the best books to read, ever"
--- 

<p>
    I was the type of kid who read at least one book a day. 
</p> 

<p>
    I've always loved reading. Librarians knew me by name, 
    and my parents never ran out of Christmas present ideas. I stayed up way too late, just trying to finish the next chapter. 
    In the car at night, I stole lines from passing streetlights. 
</p>

<p>
    Nowadays, I don't read as much as I want to. College takes up a lot of my time. 
    But these books hold a special place in my heart: maybe they will for you, too.

    1. <i>A Little Life</i>, Hanya Yanagihara

            "On and on they stare, until Jude's face becomes almost meaningless as a face to him: 
            it is a series of colors, of planes, of shapes that have been arranged in such a way to give
            other people pleasure, but to give its owner nothing. He doesn't know what he is going to do. 
            He is dizzy with what he has heard, with comprehending the enormity of his misconceptions, with stretching 
            his understanding past what is imaginable, with the knowledge that all of his carefully 
            maintained edifices are now destroyed beyond repair."

<p>
    Running at 800+ pages, this visceral novel is more of a character study than anything else. 
    It follows the life of Jude, a broken and enigmatic man haunted by his past, and his circle of friends in 
    New York. Some view it as a masterpiece; others call it misery porn. I'm of the former opinion. 
    It explores the nature of friendship, abuse, love, addiction, art, and what it means to be utterly human.
    It is the most beautifully written book I've ever read, and also the most heartbreaking. Read at your own risk.

    2. <i>Gödel, Escher, and Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</i>, Douglas R. Hofstadter
</h3>

            "Can all of reality be turned into a formal system? In a very broad sense, the answer might appear to be yes.
            One could suggest, for instance, that reality is itself nothing but one very complicated formal system. Its symbols
            do not move around on paper, but rather in a three-dimensional vacuumm; they are the elementary particles of which 
            everything is composed. The 'typographical rules' are the laws of physics, which tell how, given the 
            positions and velocities of all particles at a given instant, to modify them, resulting in a new set of 
            positions and velocities belonging to the 'next' instance."

    I bought this book as a souvenir from The Strand in NYC, and am only 100 pages in. It's difficult to describe the premise: 
    roughly, how Gödelian loops in formal systems give way to some sort of awareness, animation, a "sense of self." 
    I've discovered fugues and canons, axioms and theorems, recursion, paradoxes, isomorphisms, geometry, number theory. 
    It's brilliantly written and encourages you to savor each concept: thumb through my copy to find post-its exploring the MU-puzzle, 
    notes working through a formal system representing primality using hyphen-strings, or an airplane napkin reminding me to 
    listen to Bach's <i>Contrapunctus</i>. 
    It's by far the most intelligent novel I've ever enjoyed - anyone interested in math, consciousness, 
    or philosophy should pick it up at least once.

    3. <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>, Orson Scott Card 
</h3>

        "Those few seconds in which parts of her mind came to a halt were not trivial in their effect on her. There was 
        trauma, loss, change; she was not now the same being she was before. Parts of her had died. 
        Parts of her had become confused, out of order; her hierarchy of attention was no longer under complete control.
        She kept losing the focus of her attention, shifting to meaningless activities on worlds that meant nothing
        to her; she began randomly twitching, spilling errors into hundreds of different systems.
        She discovered, as many a living being had discovered, that rational decisions are far more easily made than carried out."

    I started this book as a sci-fi hater; in fact, the only reason I read it was because a friend recommended Ender's Game. 
    Ender's Game was alright, but I heard the sequel was better. Indeed, it was: I poured through the pages, 
    entranced by Ender's journey to Lusitania. The mystery of the "piggies," the descolada virus, and a sentient 
    super-powered AI capable of instantaneous communication across light-years? I've never been as hooked.

    4. <i>The Phantom Tollbooth</i>, Norton Juster
</h3>

<div class="text-center">

            "'Don't be too sure,' said the child patiently, 'for one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else
            you might care to learn, is that many of the things which can never be, often are. You see,' he went on, 'it's very 
            much like your trying to reach Infinity. You know that it's there but you just don't know where - but 
            just because you can never reach it doesn't mean it's not worth looking for.'" 
        </p>

    This book serves as a love letter to the pursuit of knowledge. Whenever things get difficult, I turn to this book and 
    rediscover the joy of learning. It stars Milo, a boy who "[regards] the process of seeking knowledge as the 
    greatest waste of time," and his journey to rescue the princesses Rhyme and Reason.  
    Clever and witty, this novel shines brighter the City of Illusions, sings sweeter than the Symphony of Color, and 
    will definitely bring you out of the Doldrums.

            operating system and that prayers are just so much spam... you should know that if we do kill you 
            then we'll just delete you. You got that? One click and you're overwritten with random ones and zeros. 
            Undelete is not an option.'"

    Shadow Moon, having just served his prison sentence, re-enters the world and finds his wife dead and a stranger 
    offering him a mysterious job. He is whisked across America, caught on the edge of a war between the Old Gods 
    and the New Gods.
    As an avid traveler, but also as someone who grew up in the middle of nowhere, the pages hit deep, and hard. 
    Gray winters in small towns, jukebox bars, gleaning cities, broken-down apartments in Chi, sea breeze in SF: 
    Gaiman captured 21 years of my feelings in a single novel. It's bittersweet and deliciously dark.

    Happy reading, kids! For best results: curl up in a blanket nest, pet a cat, and sip a warm drink.
