description: "when productivity feels foreign"

<p style="white-space: pre;">
I changed the wallpaper of my MacBook Air 
with its M1 chip and 8 GB RAM 
to match yours. 
It's the one you asked my opinion on: 
the pale sun rising 
on a virtual beach 
transforming in the background of cluster deployments 
until the rocks and waves 
cast shadows 
of dark fuschia and royal purple, 
a fantasy land. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
I configure my screens in perfect order,
notes to labs to the gcloud CLI
with the flick of my wrist, 
and my thoughts reach my fingers, the files, 
like lightning, 
the keys click-clacking 
sharp 
electric 
instantaneous. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
I am suddenly you - 
eyes darting to the next task 
never staying still for a moment, 
servant to the screen,
face aglow in blue light, 
instant gratification in the form of pop-up notifications. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
But even as I mirror this mastery 
(the computer) 
(the terminal)
(the IDE)
I am not you. 
I cannot locate that cool confidence 
you charmed me with, 
nor the intuition 
only years of curiosity can grant. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
Forever in the shadow of your brilliance 
    (always Adam, never Eve) 
    (always Eve, never the apple) 
I stand, 
waiting, 
for clarity. 
</p>
