<p class="text-center">
  With the end of the semester came my first (and long awaited) trip to NYC. We stayed for a week in Manhattan, 
  hopping the F train to SoHo, Chinatown, the Lower East Side, Greenwich, and just about every other neighborhood. 
  Anything you can think of, we did - highlights include holiday markets, Times Square, and seeing Wicked on Broadway!
