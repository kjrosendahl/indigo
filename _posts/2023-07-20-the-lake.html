<p style="white-space: pre;">
the familiarity of our synchronous typing 
    is replaced by brain-dead interns 
        who think AI will solve all their problems 
and the intimacy of our shared office 
    your legs on mine 
is replaced with carbon-copy workspaces 
    and I'm alone. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
but outside of work 
    outside of the daily slog 
        that trails me east to west 
            to east again 
my days no longer crawl. 
    they fly 
        along LSD 
            wind slicking my hair, 
                charlie's infinity. 
it's that saltwater breeze to midsummer dream pipeline 
    spinning adrenaline from spare time 
        instead of sleeping. 
</p>

<p style="white-space: pre;">
I admit, 
    it's not as romantic 
but at least my skin rejoices 
    in wayward fountain sprays, 
and I find clarity 
    in the lake's silver lustre 
        that which I thought 
            unobtainable. 
</p>
