    <a href="https://linktr.ee/iit_wistem" target="_blank">WiSTEM</a> is a student-led 
    organization at IIT, founded in 2020. Our goal is to create
     a community of women in STEM fields, as well 
    as provide support and opportunities across many different majors. 
</p>
<p>
    WiSTEM comrpises of an executive board, STEM major represenatives, and general body members. In August 2021, I began 
    serving as the Applied Mathematics representative. Since May 2022, I have been the treasurer on the board.
</p>

<p>
    As treasurer, I meet weekly to discuss, plan, and promote organization events. WiSTEM primarily focuses on professional development, 
    community volunteering, and social events. I handle all event purchases, supplies, and budget requests with IIT. 
    Additionally, I handle our sponsorships with Chase Bank and Virtu Financial; these companies collaborate with WiSTEM in hosting 
    information sessions and connect with IIT students on career/internship opportunities. 
</p>

<p>
    When I was the AMAT representative, I was the line of commmunication between the organization and other students in AMAT. 
    I promoted and sent out information regarding semester events to professors and peers, as well as help 
    set up and run the events. I also wrote for our newsletter and opportunities spreadsheet, which comprised of 
    scholarships, internships and research opportunities, clubs, and resources at IIT relating to AMAT. 
</p>

Aside from events, I love speaking to new and prospective students on behalf of WiSTEM.

<p>
    Our organization has a very active Instagram account, with members often doing an "Instagram Takeover," which I have done twice thus far.
    I posted my classes of the day, shared school tips, and had a Q&A session about myself and my major.

    Additionally, WiSTEM has a very active Instagram account. 
    Members often do an "Instagram Takeover." I have 
    done the takeover twice thus far: once while I was a math rep, and once as the co-treasurer. 
    I posted my classes of the day, shared school tips, and answered questions about my major and myself!

    Professors have also invited me to talk to Applied Math: Intro to the Profession classes to discuss my experience and WiSTEM.

<!-- 
Aside from events, my favorite WiSTEM activities are the newsletter and takeovers! 

<p>
    A few times a semester, board members and representatives write and publish newsletters 
    on the WiSTEM website. Articles discuss future events, featured women in STEM, editorials, and more! 
    For Vol. 3, Issue 2, I wrote for the section "New in STEM".
    The article, "<a href="https://sites.google.com/iit.edu/wistem/newsletters/volume-3-issue-2-text-version?authuser=0#h.bmfi9l90iqud"
    target="_blank">Molten Mathematics</a>," reviewed the work of mathematicians studying Surtseyan 
    volcanic bombs in 2021, and discussed the use of computer simulations in research across STEM.
