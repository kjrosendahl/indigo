    target="_blank">Research in Industrial Projects for Students</a> (RIPS) 
    is an industrial research program held yearly by UCLA's Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM). Students from around the globe come 
    and work on projects given by industry sponsors. I had the wonderful opportunity to travel to LA, meet some seriously cool people, and write 
    plenty of code in the summer of 2022.
    My team's project, "<em>Distributed Kalman Filter Designs and Experiments for Proliferated Low Earth Orbit (pLEO) Satellite Constellations</em>,"
    was sponsored by 
    <a href="https://aerospace.org/" target="_blank">The Aerospace Corporation</a>, a research and development center located in El Segundo, CA.
</p>
<p>
    My team focused on clock synchronization for pLEO constellations, a relatively new type of satellite system of interest to Aerospace. 
    For this problem, we used Kalman filters and distributed Kalman filters, which are state estimation algorithms.

<p>
    We implemented three distributed algorithms in Python: the Naive filter, the Primitive Distributed Kalman Filter (PDKF), and the 
    Decentralized Collaborative Localization (DCL) algorithm. 
    We then ran various experiments with these filters. 
</p>

<p>  
    I wrote the code for the Naive filter and PDFK, which ran each algorithm and displayed their results. 
    Since the filters relied on helper classes, which kept track of a single satellite state, I also helped develop and debug
    these classes.
</p>

<p>  
    After finishing the code for each filter, we then began experimentation. 
    I tuned the Naive filter, which meant varying parameters such as clock noise and initial clock uncertainty. 
    This, in combination with varying the number of satellites and planes in the constellation, showed tuning could lead to 
    lower values of satellite bias uncertainties. 
</p>

<p>
    From this, my team turned towards tuning the DCL algorithm. When we saw convergence of satellite uncertainties, 
    we began to focus more on DCL, as it seemed to have the best performance out of all our filters. 
</p>

<p>
    Our other experiments with the DCL algorithm included varying the constellation sizes, limiting communcation 
    between planes, and changing the order of measurement updates. 
</p>
  
<p>
    At the end of the summer, we summarized our work and results to the Aerospace Corporation and IPAM, in both an outbrief and a final report.
    For the presentation, I explained each filter and the parameters used in our initial experiments, and reviewed the initial results.
    In the report, I further laid out the mathematics of each algorithm, and their implementation.

<p>
    My team plans on presenting a poster on our work at the 
    <a href="https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org//jmm" target="_blank"> Joint Mathematics Meeting</a> in 
    Boston, January 2023. 
    Additionally, I plan on attending the 
    <a href = "https://math.unl.edu/ncuwm" target="_blank"> Nebraska Conference for Undergraduate Women in Mathematics</a>
    in January to present our research.
