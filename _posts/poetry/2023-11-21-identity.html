<p>
    if you're reading this, it's likely you're a liar OR 
    I did something irreversibly stupid, thus rendering your promise null.
    you know who you are. 
    enjoy.

<p style="white-space:pre;">
    to them, I am a fairy. 
    I hold the secrets of eternal youth 
    below my skin, 
    and I stride with manic energy,
    never stopping, 
    never sleeping. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre;">
    to you, I am a mystery
    a misunderstanding
    something to be analyzed
    whose demeanor you examine, 
    whose words you sift, 
    untangling me into my triviality 
    until there's nothing left. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre;">
    I never know which is right. 
    all I am 
    and all I will ever be 
    is a figment of your interpretation.
