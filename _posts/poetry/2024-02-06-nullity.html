<p>
    if you're reading this, things have likely gone south OR you broke your promise. 
    either way, I'm pry angry, so I don't particularly care if you read this or not. 
    thanks. 
    enjoy.

<p style="white-space:pre;">
    public playlists and film discussion 
    lay in the confines of my null space 
    to be realized only when 
    you're not around. 
    I've tried it once, twice, three times before 
    and was met with careless criticism 
    a dismissal of the highest order 
    which you hardly recognize.

<p style="white-space:pre;">
    my poetry isn't real poetry 
    and my captions don't seem like me 
    and my thoughts aren't my own, 
    but a perversion of something more clever 
    and if this is my projection 
    of your pretension, your presentation 
    of a narcissistic, self-assured 
    piece of contention, 
    well, then 
    I truly don't know 
    what I'm supposed to say.
