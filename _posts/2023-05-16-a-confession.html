<p style="white-space:pre;">
When I play your songs 
I breathe too deep 
and when others do, 
I don't breathe at all. 
As if the melodies
(for you) 
and harmonies
(for me) 
are sacraments, 
sweet wine, 
consumed on days when I haven't atoned. 
I follow the ritual - 
Aha and Elton and Taylor crooning - 
pouring over your holy texts, 
cast my shadow against gold-stained walls, 
and wonder what controls me. 
To keep searching for what no longer exists. 

But in those other places - 
my sister's car, 
my best friend's playlists - 
it's distorted. 
Wrong. 
Godless. 
They are non-believers, 
free to live as if you never existed, 
free to chase something more permanent. 
... 
I confess, 
I would almost envy them, 
except
... 
I still sing.
