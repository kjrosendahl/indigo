<p style="white-space:pre;">
I've made the decision 
to strike you from record - 
from friend questions, from conversations, from everything - 
as if to keep your name untouched 
pure 
although, in my mouth, 
perhaps it's already ruined. 
in these pages, you are nameless,
your life pieced together by my shaking memory, 
in the dark when I can't sleep. 
my friends wonder 
what we were 
for I pin our pictures up 
and refuse to speak 
(and never will). 
and even if I tried 
I'd lose...
    something. 
the secrecy, 
the fragility, 
the illusion of imperfect romance. 
the image I have of you 
and the summer. 


goodnight, you.
