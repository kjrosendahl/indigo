desription: "My recommendations after spending a summer in LA"
---

<p>My first impression of Los Angeles? Way too hot. My second impression? Incredibly languid.</p>
<p>
    In June 2022, I arrived at LAX with my trusty backpack and two suitcases in tow. 
    I had just flown in from O'Hare, leaving my beloved Chicago for the summer. 
    I was to spend two months at a math program, conducting research on UCLA campus. 
    I didn't know anyone else - all I had were the names of my teammates, who I hadn't reached out to. 
    Despite this, I had been excited for months. I love to travel; moreover, I love to travel to big cities. 
    I figured LA held millions of opportunities, and I was determined to explore as much as possible. 
</p>

<p>
    I quickly learned LA was nothing like the (admittedly short list of) cities I'd visited before. 
    For one, it was clearly not as flat as the Midwest. Lugging a 50-lb suitcase up the many, many hills of UCLA will tell you that. 
    Second, it was way larger than I had expected. 
    When I heard of "downtown" LA, I imagined a hustling, bustling city-center 10 minutes away, complete with criss-crossing transit lines 
    and hundreds of pedestrians. Instead, my first weekend there, I took an hour-long bus ride and found the downtown streets to be quiet - 
    almost abandoned compared to the Chicago Loop. 
</p>

<p> 
    Overall, what struck me as the strangest was the day-to-day feel. 
    When I think of my days in SoCal, the memories are enveloped in a hazy filter. 
    The mountains surrounding us reminded me of the city's vastness, giving me something akin to existential dread. 
    Having no car, I used public transportation; however, the long rides, waits, and transfers felt taxing. 
    Maybe some people love the weather - it hardly rained the entire time I was there, the temperature rarely fluctuated, 
    and it remained perpetually sunny. For me, it felt more oppressive - like time slowed down, and days bled into one another. 
</p>

<p> 
In essence: 
</p>

<p>
<b>LA served as the perfect embodiment of the dog-days of summer.</b>
</p>

<p> 
    I might be slightly biased: I've always hated summer the most. 
    But despite my initial grievances, I learned to love the days. On the weekends, I explored beaches and musuems. 
    On the weekdays, after a long work session, I'd grab cold, sweet boba in Westwood with friends.
    And each day, even as I ran out of breath trekking up and down the hills on campus, I'd eat lunch outside with my team 
    and allowed myself to relax. 
</p>

<p> 
Upon returning to Illinois, my family and friends asked me the usual: 
<ul>
    <li>Did you see any celebrities?</li>
    <li>Did you see the Hollywood sign? </li> 
    <li>Are you a total California girl now?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
My answers, to their disappointment: 
<ul>
    <li>No.</li>
    <li>Unintentionally.</li> 
    <li>Definitely not.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
    Even with that hazy feel - which you'll only understand if you've been there before -
    I still have fond memories of my time in California. I made a few friends, ate tons of food, and even sang karaoke for the first time! 
    (And second, third, fourth... time. I lost count.) 
    So, with the long narrative out of the way, here is a list of the best things I did in LA (in no particular order): 
</p>

<h3> 1. Grand Central Market</h3>

<p> 
    The Grand Central Market is a busy venue in downtown LA, comprising of dozens of unique food vendors and small shops. 
    Imagine a large, open-air floor, creative menu signs, and stalls boasting every type of cuisine you could think of. 
    Crowds press against the open counters, and bright red metal seats and tables spill out into the streets. 
    I saw a stall dedicated solely to PB&J, and another for 15 different flavors of Jarritos. 
</p>

<p> 
    I don't know if I could be called a foodie (I wouldn't consider myself "refined" enough), 
    but I certainly love trying new food, and this place is must. 
    I went three times in total. The first: I ventured alone on my first Saturday in LA, 
    and ate the best ice cream of my life. The second time, I visited with a friend, re-ordered the ice cream, 
    and had doenjang-marinated chicken. The last time, my roommate and I went out for lunch, this time having a Japanese katsu sandwich. 
</p>

<p> 
    Go for the food. If you don't like food, go for the smells. 
</p>

<h3>2. The Last Bookstore</h3>

<p> 
    Just around the corner from the market is The Last Bookstore, a two-story place filled with (you guessed it): books! 
    Both floors are packed with bookshelves; check out rare books and vinyls downstairs, or shops and a book tunnel upstairs. 
    You can also make your way around the balcony overlooking the lower level. 
    Sprinkled throughout the store, you'll also find cool decor, made from things like antique bric-a-brac or dessicated book pages. 
</p>

<p> 
    I had tons of fun browsing the stacks, local art shops, and galleries. 
    For book and book-adjacent enthusiants, I would recommend visiting. 
</p>

<h3>3. Santa Monica Pier</h3>

<p> 
    Visiting the pier was my first group outing, during my second week in LA. 
    We drove out to the beach on a Thursday evening, stepped through the rapidly cooling sand, 
    and watched the sunset. When it was dark, the pier truly lit up: 
    the ferris wheel spun neon patterns, and carnival rides flew through the air. 
    We bought overpriced churros and took a cute picture, dropping half the sugar in the process. 
    We walked to the end of the pier and I leaned on the railing, staring out into the ocean: black waves streaked with white foam. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
    Aside from the lights, I also thought the Santa Monica meme houses were pretty cool. 
</p>

<h3>4. The Getty Center</h3>

<p>
    The Getty Center is a campus comprising of an art musuem (The Getty) and a plethora of gardens and sculptures. 
    A group of us took the train, which winded up and around the mountain that the campus sat on. 
    The museum itself is a large, asymmetric building of glass and white stone. 
    Around the other side are bright gardens, reflecting pools, and fountains. 
    I've always loved that type of design: sky-high windows and clean stone, open space and plenty of light. 
</p>

<p>
    The musuem, as expected, has plenty of galleries - you could spend a whole weekend there.
    (I spent three hours looking at only paintings, and didn't even make it through all of them. For those interested, 
    my favorite was <a href="https://www.getty.edu/art/collection/object/103QTA" target="_blank">DanaÃ« and the Shower of Gold</a>.)
</p>
<p>
    I was also able to visit a special exhibit: <a href="https://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/anatomy/"
    target="_blank"><i>Flesh and Bones: The Art of Anatomy</i></a>. 
    Although not currently showing at The Getty, it had dozens of centuries-old anatomical drawings, 
    books, and modern pieces displaying human anatomy. 
</p>
<p>
    It was here I found the coolest art piece I've ever seen, entitled 
    "<a href= "https://www.nasa.gov/feature/robert-lawrence-first-african-american-astronaut" target="_blank">Robert</a>": 
    a glass skeleton suspended in a dark room, electricity and neon currents running through it. 
    It appeared to levitate and mimick nerve endings, pulsing and lighting up.
</p>

<h3>5. Venice Beach Boardwalk</h3>

<p>
    For those who like to wander and explore without a plan, try visiting the boardwalk!
    A friend and I spent a sunny Sunday afternoon walking up and down the miles-long stretch. 
    We checked out street art, performances, shops, and more. Although there were plenty of 
    places to eat, it does get quite busy with tourists, so forewarning. To avoid waiting, we decided on having ice cream for lunch
    (me: rainbow sherbert. her: birthday cake). Solid life decisions. 
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, strolling along the shore of the Pacific certainly clears your mind. We tempted fate by walking barefoot 
    in the water, quickly sprinting away and laughing when a large wave came in. I'm surprised none of our things were soaked and ruined. 
    Even though I dislike summer, messing around in the ocean with a friend isn't the worst way to spend a day. 
</p>

<h3>6. Beaches!</h3>

<p>
    I've never really enjoyed the beach. Strike one: sand gets everywhere. Strike two: salt water hurts. Strike three (maybe my fault): I can't swim. 
</p>

<p>
    But with the right company, they're worthwhile. I had a few trips to different beaches, mostly with my team. 
    We did everything you can think of: jumping over/under waves, volleyball, picnics, reading, burying each other in sand. 
    We also did some things you wouldn't think of: acrobatic yoga, spikeball, and bad parkour.
</p>

<p> 
    I recall one scene in particular: 
    I was half buried in sand, sleeping under an umbrella, sunglasses perched on my nose. My friends were around, either 
    sleeping, reading, or vibing. I could hear the ocean waves, 
    and "Young, Dumb, and Broke" was playing softly on the speaker we brought. 
    Although stereotypical, that memory is warm and bright. 
</p>

<h3>7. Westwood Delights</h3>

<p>
    After work, I spent many of my evenings exploring Westwood Village with friends. Being so close to UCLA, the neighborhood 
    comes to life at night. Edison lights are strung between palm trees and on buildings, giving off soft glows. 
    Browse bars for karaoke or trivia nights, and take advantage of restaurants open late for hungry college students. 
</p>

<p>
    Hot spots (or, those I loved) include: 
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.1992sharetea.com/" target="_blank">Sharetea</a> (for boba)</li>
        <li><a href="https://saffronrosepersianicecream.com/" target="_blank">Saffron and Rose</a> (for ice cream)</li>
        <li><a href="https://meetfresh.us/" target="_blank">MeetFresh</a> (for boba and dessert)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/dipandmix/" target="_blank">dipnmix</a> (for overstuffing on dessert)</li>
        <li><a href="https://elyseebakery.business.site" target="_blank">Elysee Cafe</a> (for brunch)</li>
        <li><a href="https://hammer.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">The Hammer Museum</a> (for art, not hammers)</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    Special shoutout to <a href="https://bellapita.com/" target="_blank">Bella Pita</a> 
    for introducing to me the joys of "wowshi" and humoring our 2AM adventures.

<p>
    My days in LA were some of the best I've ever had. I hang the pictures above my desk, and smile when I think of all the 
    jokes and adventures. I won't attribute that joy to the city alone, but also to the people I was with. Maybe that's 
    personal preference, but for anyone looking to visit SoCal: make sure to bring a friend. It'll be worth it.
