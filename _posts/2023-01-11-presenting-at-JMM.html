description: "My week in Boston at the biggest math conference in the world"
--- 

<p>
    Unlike many people, I did not go bar-hopping on my 21st birthday. 
</p>

<p> 
    Instead, I went out to dinner, ordered one glass of ros√©, and crawled into bed at 10pm. 
    After a long battle with sleep, I left the apartment at 4am to catch a flight to Boston.
    Why? I was attending the
    <a href="https://www.jointmathematicsmeetings.org//jmm" target="_blank"> Joint Mathematics Meeting</a> (JMM), the largest math conference
    in the world, to present a poster on <a href="RIPS-research.html">research I had done the previous summer</a>. 
</p>

<p>
    I spent the next four days running back and forth across the Prudential Center complex, located in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston. 
    It was a strange amalgamation: imagine a shopping mall, roughly in the shape of a plus sign. 
    Two of the ends led to hotels, while another led to the train station. 
    Interspersed were offices, restaurants, stores, and an outside garden park. 
    I could attend a talk, grab lunch at a cafe, crash in my hotel room, catch the T, and browse the racks... all without stepping foot outside. 
</p>

<p>
    While slightly chaotic, it was very gorgeous. The mall itself boasted skylights and dripping golden lights. 
    One wing was populated with plants and flowers, and had an arching glass wall - you could sit and gaze at the sky. 
    To get to and from my hotel, I crossed a skybridge; stop in the middle, and you could see Huntington Avenue stretched out in front of you. 
</p>

<p>
    JMM was mainly held in the Hynes Convention Center. It didn't look like much, until I walked to the heart of the center. 
    Here, it was more of an open atrium, standing at three stories tall. Facing northeast were floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Boston, 
    where many mathematicians worked on their presentations and research. Every single room or hall hosted a speaker at any given time; 
    I often saw students racing up and down the escalators to attend a talk.
</p>

<p>
    To be honest, my time at JMM was mostly a blur. I didn't have the chance, or motivation, to explore Boston as much as I had intended, 
    since it was raining the entire time. And with a crammed event schedule from 8am to 8pm, I spent my time drifting from talk to talk, 
    returning to my room for long cat-naps, and trying to meet up with other students from my research program. 
</p>

<p>
    Despite being a "mathematician" at math conference, I felt slightly out of place, for several reasons. 
</p>

<p>
    First, I wouldn't be able to tell you what I learned from the talks I did attend (unless they involved graph theory). 
    In fact, I didn't understand most of them. While there's a certain beauty in the vastness of mathematics, 
    it's overwhelming to get lost in the notation and theorems only five slides into the session. 
</p>

<p>
    Second, I have no interest in pursuing a PhD after I graduate.  
    I've learned that's the third thing people will ask you at a conference, right after your name and institution.
    My academic status is sort of in limbo: 
    I am currently studying for both a Bachelor's and Master's degree. So, I'm considered an undergraduate student, 
    but am technically in grad school. Yet, it doesn't feel quite the same. When other people talk about applications, 
    research interests, and the 'grad-student' life, I'm not a part of that conversation, nor would I have the 
    right to be. 
</p>

<p>
    Nevertheless, some of my acquaintances felt a lot more at home. They pointed out how welcoming, if strange, it was: to sit a room, 
    and realize every single person in it was like you. You didn't have to seek out fellow mathematicians; they were already 
    there. You didn't have to worry about being "too much", or "too excited" about your work, because chances were, 
    someone else would be ready to listen. 
</p>

<p>
    I, personally, did not have this relevation at JMM. It was only afterwards, when I had time to reflect, 
    did I realize the connection I had to everyone else. That is not to say I belonged more than I thought (a bold statement). 
    After all, I didn't suddenly change my mind about grad school, or soak up years of mathematical knowledge, in four days. 
    Rather, I recognized smaller details. Moments of clarity. Cohesiveness. 
</p>

<p>
    That's a little abstract. Let's move to empirical evidence.
