<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
a year has passed, my darling - 
but that's not right, is it? 
for you were never quite mine, 
though your heart beat too fast 
just for me, 
and you searched for the stars 
with me, 
and you held me in your arms 
until I fell asleep. 
and yet, I still write poetry,
write unsent letters, 
play songs on repeat 
with the hope of keeping you alive, 
close, 
ever-so-bright, 
like the time bled, 
like those dog-days, 
the first time I ever wanted forever. 
how can I enter those same 
oppressing 
suffocating 
months 
without someone to breathe life back into me? 
the chalk-streaked fingers, 
carefully smudging my skin, 
christening,
or tracing my elegant wrists 
like beautiful code, 
our bodies curving together 
in sticky heat. 
I can't hear lapping waves 
without tasting strawberries - 
the sugary fructose 
keeping sweat at bay - 
and without feeling sandy grit 
between our skin, 
as I swayed on your shoulders, 
your bony frame the only thing 
between me and the ground. 
maybe I loved you, 
or maybe I had sun-tinted glasses, 
but your soft r's 
and non-existent h's 
echo when I read your inscription 
for the hundredth time. 
I blush at our magnetism, 
which seemed unavoidable, 
and dream of a life 
where everything is back 
the way it was. 
endlessly waiting for you 
in my abandoned, glowing room, 
and endlessly recieiving you.
