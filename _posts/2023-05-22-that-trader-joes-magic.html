The Trader Joe's font 
is something else entirely. 
        Low-fat guac, 
                strawberry mochi, 
                        boxes of mysterious cookies, 
their names carefully painted in thick black strokes. 
You saunter down the aisles, 
at home, 
Mr. Bougie Californian, 
tossing in your favorite pre-made salad 
(because god forbid you eat anything non-organic). 
I, on the other hand, 
am out of place - 
squinting, 
absorbing each description.
Suddenly, there are options - 
snacks I've never heard of, 
cheap wine you say is delightful, 
which I take your word for, 
until we're lying on the floor, laughing, 
pouring out frothy bubbles that spin my head. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
Our first journey yields 
a box of Driscoll raspberries 
(though I prefer blueberries), 
and as we walk, 
I stain my fingers red
offering some to you.
When you take one, 
we bite down on the sour, bursting fruit, 
the seeds rubbing against my teeth, 
and I think this is heaven. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
Impromptu TJ trips become a summer staple. 
Each time, 
you disappear along the shelves, 
I debate if my office 
truly needs more food 
(after all, it takes a lot of energy to fight this haze), 
and I search for you: 
the boy with bomba, 
or bars of chocolate so bitter, I choke. 
When you glance at me, 
your face brightens - maybe 
it's because you were looking, too 
rather than a consequence of these overhead lights. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
The last journey surprises me. 
It starts as a confession over persian ice cream 
(which we take turns holding, lest our fingers 
freeze in this 80 degree heat) - 
you grab my hand 
and drag me down that familiar street, 
stepping through the sliding doors, 
a man on a mission. 
You present to me 
expensive pomegranate seeds 
and sweetened dates, 
for no reason 
except to gift me something new. 
As if you weren't enough. 
</p>

<p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">
The Westwood store on Weyburn 
no longer welcomes our shining faces. 
I frequent the one on Wabash and Roosevelt, 
addicted to their frozen dumplings and dried mango 
(introduced to me by the team, late in the office and barefoot). 
You bike to Meadow Street, 
I'm sure, 
for salads and chocolate and wine. 
You've convinced me 
of that Trader Joe's magic - 
but whether that's the 
        tiny pork wontons 
                or how you leaned into the freezers, 
        the hard apple ciders 
                or how you fumbled with your ID at the register, 
        the syrupy mandarin slices 
                or how you smiled and asked if I was ready to leave - 
I'll never quite know.
