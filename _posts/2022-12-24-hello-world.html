desription: "My first blog post on writing!"
--- 

<p> Surprising to everyone but my friends: I love words, and I love to write.</p>

<p>
    I've enjoyed it ever since I was a child. I carried around notebooks and stayed up well into the night typing into Google Docs. 
    I wrote poetry, lined my arms with song lyrics, and edited my friends' school essays. 
    Not a lot of people expect this from a STEM major; they figure I live in a world of numbers and code. 
    I don't blame them, considering I wanted to pursue something math-y my entire life. However, there was a brief period in middle school 
    where I was convinced I would be a journalist. 
</p>

<p>
    In my past writing classes, I think a lot of my classmates struggled to meet the minimum page requirement. 
    You always hear "tips and tricks" to increase your word count (and those "tips" usually tell you to replace concise, 
    beautiful words with clunky, long, unnecessary phrases). 
    I have the opposite problem: I struggle to keep my essays short. It's less that I ramble, and more that I just have a lot to say. 
    For those awful timed essays in high school, I roughly outlined my plan in five minutes, then spent the rest of the hour 
    scribbling as fast as I could. I never once had a class where I didn't ask for extra paper. 
</p>
<p>
    Once I entered college, most of my writing was contained in fun, off-hours activities. I write letters to my friends, and leave 
    post-it notes with jokes and funny drawings on them for my roommate. I have a (perhaps unreasonably) large collection of cards, 
    cardstock, and pens, just waiting to be used. 
</p>
<p>
    Regardless, I find opportunities. This last semester, I was assigned to write a paper on how automation is being used 
    to address climate change - so, pretty interesting. I sat down, and next thing I know - it's four hours and nine pages later, all done in the blink of an eye. 
    Ironically, my math professors also see this side of me. I burn through several packs of paper each semester for homework, and my proofs 
    are not nearly as concise as they expect. One year, I looked over an exam returned by a professor. 
    Although I recieved full marks for one particular problem, they had written, "Please streamline for brevity".
</p>
<p>
    All of this is to say: when I find a chance to express my thoughts, I try to express every one of them. It's also much easier writing them down 
    than saying them out loud. I enjoy putting words to paper (or characters to a screen), and I see it as exciting. Almost visceral. 
</p>

    I've been working on this website for about three months now. An older version was much more basic, and certainly much less cool. 
    I didn't know much about web development, so I learned some basic HTML and wrote it entirely in vanilla HTML/CSS over the course 
    of a few weeks. I was pretty proud of it at first, but an acquaintance of mine suggested I switch to Jekyll instead. 
    Having a busy semester, I tabled that task, and told myself I'd get around to it when the chaos had ended. 
    So today, now on break, I kicked up my feet, wrapped myself in a blanket, and poured through tutorials and documentation. 
    It took a while (as I write this, it is past 3am - where does the time go?), but I finally found a point where I'm happy with what 
    I made. 
</p>
<p>
    I hope to populate my site with more fun, quirky things that I love. I still have to migrate a wonderful gallery of my favorite pictures
    from the old site, and update my research projects to accommodate several conferences I will be attending (soon!). 
    Throughout it all, I look foward to learning more: becoming a better coder, and a better writer.
</p> 
<p> 
    To those that know me, I say: yes, I know I'm a total nerd. 
</p>
<p>
    And to everyone else, I say: Hello, World!
