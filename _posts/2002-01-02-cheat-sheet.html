    Want to learn about me and my personal interests, but don't have the time to read my lengthy blog posts? 
    You found the right page! (Sh... it's a secret. Don't tell anyone.)

    <i>Why make a website?</i>
</p>

<p>
    My academic advisor mentioned in my second year how I should have a website to showcase my projects and a little about myself. 
    I pondered this for a while; I have always wanted a personal site, reminiscent of the era of MySpace and IM.
</p>

<p>
    The thing is, I wanted total control, and this meant designing <i>anything</i> I wanted. I had used website builders in high school, 
    but they didn't have quite the same freedom I was seeking. I wanted to create something I could be proud of, understand what was going behind the scenes. and have fun! 
</p>

<p>
    So, I doubled down and started studying front-end design. HTML, CSS, a little JavaSript: the works. You can see the result here! 
    I did use a Jekyll theme, but I'm still parsing and exploring the files. 
    It was through this project I found my interest in front-end engineering. After graduation, I hope to continue following this passion. 
</p>

<p>
    I'm pretty sure my advisor was suggesting something along the lines of a Google site, but I've never been one to color inside the lines.
