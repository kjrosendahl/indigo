desription: My recommendations for visiting LA
---

<p> My first impression of Los Angeles? Way too hot. My second impression? Incredibly languid.</p>

<p>
    In June, I arrived at LAX with my trusty backpack and two suitcases in tow. 
    I had just flown in from O'Hare, leaving my beloved Chicago for the summer. 
    I was to spend two months at a math program, conducting research on UCLA campus. 
    I didn't know anyone else in the program - just the names of my teammates, who I hadn't bothered reaching out to. 
    Despite this, I had been excited for months. I love to travel; moreover, I love to travel to big cities. 
    I figured LA, though completely unknown and foreign to me, held millions of opportunities, and I was determined to see all that I could.
</p>

<p>
    I quickly learned LA was nothing like the (admittedly short list of) cities I'd visited before. 
    For one, it was clearly not as flat as the Midwest. Lugging a 50-lb suitcase up the many, many hills of UCLA will tell you that. 
    Second, it was way larger than I had expected. 
    When I heard of "downtown" LA, I imagined a hustling, bustling city-center 10 minutes away, complete with criss-crossing transit lines 
    and hundreds of pedestrians. Instead, my first weekend there, I took an hour-long bus ride and found the downtown streets to be quiet - 
    almost desolate, or abandoned, compared to the Chicago Loop. 
</p>

<p> 
    Overall, what struck me as the strangest was the day-to-day feel. 
    When I think of my days in SoCal, the memories are enveloped in a hazy filter. 
    The mountains surrounding us reminded me of the city's vastness, giving me something akin to existential dread. 
    Having no car, I used public transportation; however, the long rides, waits, and transfers felt taxing. 
    Maybe some people love the weather - it hardly rained the entire time I was there, the temperature rarely fluctuated, 
    and it remained perpetually sunny. For me, it felt more oppressive - like time slowed down, and days bled into one another. 
</p>

<p> 
In essence: 
</p>

<p>
<b>LA served as the perfect embodiment of the dog-days of summer.</b>
</p>

<p> 
    I might be slightly biased: I've always hated summer the most. I contest autumn and winter are the best for travel and adventure. 
    But despite my grievances, I still went out whenever I could. On the weekends, I explored beaches and musuems. 
    On the weekdays, after a long work session, I'd grab cold, sweet boba in Westwood with my friends. 
    And each day, even as I ran out of breath trekking up and down the hills on campus, I'd sit outside eating lunch with my team, 
    and allowed myself to relax. 
</p>

<p> 
When I returned to Illinois, my family and friends asked me the usual: 
<ul>
    <li>Did you see any celebrities?</li>
    <li>Did you see the Hollywood sign? </li> 
    <li>Are you a total California girl now?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
My answers, to their disappointment: 
<ul>
    <li>No.</li>
    <li>Accidentally.</li> 
    <li>Definitely not.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
    Even with that hazy feel - which you'll only truly understand once you're there -
    I still have fond memories of my time in California. I made a few friends, tried new food, and even sang karaoke for the first time! 
    (And second, third, fourth... time. I lost count.) 
    So, with the long narrative out of the way, here is a list of my favorite things I did in LA.
</p>

<h3> 1. Grand Central Market</h3>

<p> 
    The Grand Central Market is a busy venue in downtown LA, comprising of dozens of unique food vendors and small shops. 
    Imagine a large, open-air floor, neon signs with vendor names, and chaotic stalls boasting every type of cuisine you could think of. 
    Crowds press against the open counters, and bright red metal seats and tables spill out into the streets. 
    I saw a stall dedicated solely to PB&J, and another for 15 different flavors of Jarritos. 
</p>

<p> 
    I don't know if I could be called a foodie (I wouldn't consider myself "refined" enough), 
    but I certainly love trying different things, and this place is must. 
    I went three times in total. The first: I went alone on my first Saturday in LA, 
    and tried the best ice cream of my life. The second time, I went with a friend, re-ordered the ice cream, 
    and had doenjang-marinated chicken. The last time, my roommate and I went out for lunch, this time eating a Japanese katsu sandwich. 
</p>

<p> 
Go for the food. If not, go for the smells. 
</p>

<h3>2. The Last Bookstore</h3>

<p> 
    Just around the corner from the market is The Last Bookstore, a two-story place filled with (you guessed it): books! 
    Downstairs hosts bookshelves, rare books, vinyls, and more. Upstairs are more books, 
    or you can make your way around the balcony overlooking the lower level. 
    I also had fun browsing local art shops and galleries. 
    Sprinkled throughout the store, you'll find cool art pieces made from dessicated book pages, book tunnels, and several other hidden treasures.
</p>

<p> 
    For book and book-adjacent enthusiants, I would recommend visiting. Yes, I did buy a book. 
    Yes, I also bought an artsy postcard. Definitely worth it. 
</p>

<h3>3. Santa Monica Pier</h3>

<p> 
    This was the first thing I did with other people, during my second week in LA. 
    We drove out to the beach on a Thursday evening, stepped through the rapidly cooling sand, 
    and watched the sunset behind a mountain. When it was dark, the pier truly lit up: 
    the ferris wheel spun neon patterns, and carnival rides flew through the air. 
    We bought overpriced churros and took a cute picture, dropping half the sugar in the process. 
    We walked to the end of the pier, and I leaned on the railing, staring out into the ocean - black waves streaked with white foam.

<p>
    Aside from the lights, I also thought the Santa Monica meme houses were pretty cool.
