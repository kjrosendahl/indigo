    <a href="https://sites.google.com/iit.edu/wistem/home" target="_blank">WiSTEM</a> is a student-led 
    organization at IIT, founded in 2020. Our goal is to create
     a community of women in STEM fields, as well 
    as provide support and opportunities across many different majors. 
</p>
<p>
    WiSTEM comprises of executive members, major representatives, and general body members. In August 2021, 
    I began serving as the Applied Mathematics representative. Since May 2022, I have been shadowing 
    for the WiSTEM treasurer position on the executive board.
</p>
<p>
    As part of the board, I meet weekly with other members to discuss and plan events, administration, 
    and other tasks to help the organization run smoothly and successfully. I will also 
    be learning how to handle budgets, our industry sponsorships, and purchases for events. 
</p>
<p>
    When I was the AMAT representative, I was the line of commmunication between the organization and other students in AMAT. 
    I promoted and sent out information regarding semester events to professors and peers, as well as help 
    set up and run the events. I also contributed to the opportunities spreadsheet, 
    which all representatives did for their respective major. Here, I updated a spreadsheet comprising of 
    scholarships, internships and research opportunities, clubs, and resources at IIT relating to AMAT. 
</p>

Aside from events, my favorite WiSTEM activities are the newsletter and takeovers! 

<p>
    A few times a semester, board members and representatives write and publish newsletters 
    on the WiSTEM website. Articles discuss future events, featured women in STEM, editorials, and more! 
    For Vol. 3, Issue 2, I wrote for the section "New in STEM".
    The article, "<a href="https://sites.google.com/iit.edu/wistem/newsletters/volume-3-issue-2-text-version?authuser=0#h.bmfi9l90iqud"
    target="_blank">Molten Mathematics</a>," reviewed the work of mathematicians studying Surtseyan 
    volcanic bombs in 2021, and discussed the use of computer simulations in research across STEM.

    Additionally, WiSTEM has a very active Instagram account. Each Thursday, a member does an "Instagram takeover",
    and posts stories for other students and members to follow. I have 
    done the takeover twice thus far: once while I was a math rep, and once as the co-treasurer. 
    I posted my classes of the day, shared school tips, and answered questions about my major and myself!
